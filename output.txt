or, in relation to building projects, by 31 December of the following financial year. 
2. 
The preparatory stages referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 12(2), which shall be completed 
by 31 December of the financial year in order to allow a carry-over to the following financial year, are in particular: 
(a) for individual budgetary commitments within the meaning of point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 112(1), the 
completion of the selection of potential contractors, beneficiaries, prize winners or delegates; 
(b) for global budgetary commitments within the meaning of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 112(1), the 
adoption of a financing decision or the closing of the consultation of the departments concerned within each Union 
institution on the adoption of the financing decision. 
3. 
Appropriations carried over in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 12(2) which have not 
been committed by 31 March of the following financial year, or by 31 December of the following financial year for 
amounts relating to building projects, shall be automatically cancelled. 
The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of the appropriations cancelled in accordance 
with the first subparagraph within one month following the cancellation. 
Article 14 
Decommitments 
1. 
Where budgetary commitments are decommitted in any financial year after the year in which they were made as a 
result of the total or partial non-implementation of the actions for which they were earmarked, the appropriations 
corresponding to such decommitments shall be cancelled, unless otherwise provided in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 
and (EU) No 514/2014 and without prejudice to Article 15 of this Regulation. 
2. 
Commitment appropriations referred to in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 and (EU) No 514/2014 shall be 
decommitted automatically in accordance with those Regulations.

Article 15 
Making appropriations corresponding to decommitments available again 
1. 
The appropriations corresponding to decommitments referred to in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) 
No 223/2014 and (EU) No 514/2014 may be made available again in the event of a manifest error attributable 
solely to the Commission. 
To that end, the Commission shall examine decommitments made during the preceding financial year and shall decide, by 
15 February of the current financial year, on the basis of requirements, whether it is necessary to make the corresponding 
appropriations available again. 
2. 
In addition to the case referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, the appropriations corresponding to decom­
mitments shall be made available again in the event of: 
(a) the decommitment from a programme under the arrangements for the implementation of the performance reserve 
established in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013; 
(b) the decommitment from a programme dedicated to a specific financial instrument in favour of small and medium- 
sized enterprises (SMEs) following the discontinuance of the participation of a Member State in the financial 
instrument, as referred to in the seventh subparagraph of Article 39(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. 
3. 
Commitment appropriations corresponding to the amount of decommitments made as a result of total or partial 
non-implementation of corresponding research projects may also be made available again to the benefit of the research 
programme the projects belong to or its successor in the context of the budgetary procedure. 
Article 16 
Rules applicable in the event of late adoption of the budget 
1. 
If the budget has not been definitively adopted at the beginning of the financial year, the procedure set out in the 
first paragraph of Article 315 TFEU (the provisional twelfths regime) shall apply. Commitments and payments may be 
made within the limits laid down in paragraph 2 of this Article. 
2. 
Commitments may be made per chapter up to a maximum of one quarter of the total appropriations authorised in 
the relevant chapter of the budget for the preceding financial year plus one twelfth for each month which has elapsed. 
The limit of the appropriations provided for in the draft budget shall not be exceeded. 
Payments may be made monthly per chapter up to a maximum of one twelfth of the appropriations authorised in the 
relevant chapter of the budget for the preceding financial year. That sum shall not, however, exceed one twelfth of the 
appropriations provided for in the same chapter of the draft budget. 
3. 
The appropriations authorised in the relevant chapter of the budget for the preceding financial year, as referred to in 
paragraphs 1 and 2, shall be understood as referring to the appropriations voted in the budget, including by amending 
budgets, and after adjustment for the transfers made during that financial year. 
4. 
If the continuity of Union action and management needs so require, the Council, acting by qualified majority on a 
proposal from the Commission, may authorise expenditure in excess of one provisional twelfth but not exceeding a total 
of four provisional twelfths, except in duly justified cases, both for commitments and for payments over and above those 
automatically made available in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2. The Council shall without delay forward its decision 
on authorisation to the European Parliament. 
The decision referred to in the first subparagraph shall enter into force 30 days after its adoption unless the European 
Parliament takes any of the following actions: 
(a) acting by a majority of its component members, decides to reduce the expenditure before the expiry of the 30 days, 
in which case the Commission shall submit a new proposal; 
(b) informs the Council and the Commission that it does not wish to reduce the expenditure, in which case the decision 
shall enter into force before the expiry of the 30 days. 
The additional twelfths shall be authorised in full and shall not be divisible. 
5. 
If, for a given chapter, the authorisation of four provisional twelfths granted in accordance with paragraph 4 is not 
sufficient to cover the expenditure necessary to avoid a break in continuity of Union action in the area covered by the 
chapter in question, authorisation may exceptionally be given to exceed the amount of the appropriations entered in the 
corresponding chapter of the budget for the preceding financial year. The European Parliament and the Council shall act 
in accordance with the procedures provided for in paragraph 4. However, the overall total of the appropriations available 
in the budget of the preceding financial year or in the draft budget, as proposed, shall in no circumstances be exceeded.

CHAPTER 3 
Principle of equilibrium 
Article 17 
Definition and scope 
1. 
Revenue and payment appropriations shall be in balance. 
2. 
The Union and the Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 shall not raise loans within the framework of the 
budget. 
Article 18 
Balance from financial year 
1. 
The balance from each financial year shall be entered in the budget for the following financial year as revenue in the 
event of a surplus or as a payment appropriation in the event of a deficit. 
2. 
The estimates of the revenue or payment appropriations referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be entered in 
the budget during the budgetary procedure and in a letter of amendment submitted pursuant to Article 42 of this 
Regulation. The estimates shall be drawn up in accordance with Article 1 of Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 
No 608/2014 ( 1 ). 
3. 
After the presentation of the provisional accounts for each financial year, any discrepancy between those accounts 
and the estimates shall be entered in the budget for the following financial year through an amending budget devoted 
solely to that discrepancy. In such a case, the Commission shall submit the draft amending budget simultaneously to the 
European Parliament and to the Council within 15 days of submission of the provisional accounts. 
CHAPTER 4 
Principle of unit of account 
Article 19 
Use of euro 
1. 
The multiannual financial framework and the budget shall be drawn up and implemented in euro and the accounts 
shall be presented in euro. However, for the cash-flow purposes referred to in Article 77, the accounting officer and, in 
the case of imprest accounts, the imprest administrators, and, for the needs of the administrative management of the 
Commission and the EEAS, the authorising officer responsible, shall be authorised to carry out operations in other 
currencies. 
2. 
Without prejudice to specific provisions laid down in sector-specific rules, or in specific contracts, grant agreements, 
contribution agreements and financing agreements, conversion by the authorising officer responsible shall be made using 
the daily euro exchange rate published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union of the day on which the 
payment order or recovery order is drawn up by the authorising department. 
If no such daily rate is published, the authorising officer responsible shall use the one referred to in paragraph 3. 
3. 
For the purposes of the accounts provided for in Articles 82, 83 and 84, conversion between the euro and another 
currency shall be made using the monthly accounting exchange rate of the euro. That accounting exchange rate shall be 
established by the accounting officer of the Commission by means of any source of information regarded as reliable, on 
the basis of the exchange rate on the penultimate working day of the month preceding that for which the rate is 
established. 
4. 
Currency conversion operations shall be carried out in such a way as to avoid having a significant impact on the 
level of the Union co-financing or a detrimental impact on the budget. Where appropriate, the rate of conversion 
between the euro and other currencies may be calculated using the average of the daily exchange rate in a given period. 
CHAPTER 5 
Principle of universality 
Article 20 
Scope 
Without prejudice to Article 21, total revenue shall cover total payment appropriations. Without prejudice to Article 27, 
all revenue and expenditure shall be entered in the budget in full without any adjustment against each other.

with Article 20. 
3. 
The estimates of amounts receivable referred to in points (b) and (g) of Article 21(2) shall be sent to the accounting

Article 28 
General provisions 
1. 
Appropriations shall be earmarked for specific purposes by title and chapter. The chapters shall be further 
subdivided into articles and items. 
2. 
The Commission and the other Union institutions may transfer appropriations within the budget subject to the 
specific conditions laid down in Articles 29 to 32. 
Appropriations may only be transferred to budget lines for which the budget has authorised appropriations or which 
carry a token entry pro memoria. 
The limits referred to in Articles 29, 30 and 31 shall be calculated at the time the request for transfer is made and with 
reference to the appropriations provided in the budget, including amending budgets. 
The amount to be taken into consideration for the purposes of calculating the limits referred to in Articles 29, 30 and 31 
shall be the sum of the transfers to be made on the budget line from which transfers are being made, after adjustment for 
earlier transfers made. The amount corresponding to the transfers which are carried out autonomously by the 
Commission, or by any other Union institution concerned without a decision of the European Parliament and of the 
Council, shall not be taken into consideration. 
Proposals for transfers and all information for the European Parliament and for the Council concerning transfers made 
under Articles 29, 30 and 31 shall be accompanied by appropriate and detailed supporting documents showing the most 
recent information available for the implementation of appropriations and estimates of requirements up to the end of the

ations: 
(a) from one title to another up to a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the financial year shown on the budget 
line from which the transfer is made; 
(b) from one chapter to another without limit. 
2. 
Without prejudice to paragraph 4 of this Article, three weeks before making a transfer, as referred to in 
paragraph 1, the Union institution shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of its intention to do so. In 
the event that duly justified objections are raised within that period by either the European Parliament or the Council, the 
procedure laid down in Article 31 shall apply.

Any Union institution other than the Commission may propose to the European Parliament and to the Council, 
within its own section of the budget, transfers from one title to another exceeding the limit referred to in point (a) of 
paragraph 1 of this Article. Those transfers shall be subject to the procedure laid down in Article 31. 
4. 
Any Union institution other than the Commission may, within its own section of the budget, make transfers within 
articles without informing the European Parliament and the Council beforehand. 
Article 30 
Transfers by the Commission 
1. 
The Commission may, within its own section of the budget, autonomously: 
(a) transfer appropriations within each chapter; 
(b) with regard to expenditure on staff and administration which is common to several titles, transfer appropriations 
from one title to another up to a maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the financial year shown on the budget 
line from which the transfer is made, and up to a maximum of 30 % of the appropriations for the financial year 
shown on the budget line to which the transfer is made; 
(c) with regard to operational expenditure, transfer appropriations between chapters within the same title up to a 
maximum of 10 % of the appropriations for the financial year shown on the budget line from which the transfer 
is made; 
(d) with regard to research and technological development appropriations implemented by the JRC, within the title of the 
budget relating to the ‘Direct research’ policy area, transfer appropriations between chapters of up to a maximum of 
15 % of the appropriations on the budget line from which the transfer is made; 
(e) with regard to research and technological development, transfer operational appropriations from one title to another, 
provided that the appropriations are used for the same purpose; 
(f) with regard to operational expenditure of the funds implemented under shared management, with the exception of 
the EAGF, transfer appropriations from one title to another, provided that the appropriations concerned are for the 
same objective within the meaning of the Regulation establishing the fund concerned or constitute technical 
assistance expenditure; 
(g) transfer appropriations from the budgetary item of a budgetary guarantee to the budgetary item of another budgetary 
guarantee, in the exceptional cases when the provisioned resources in the common provisioning fund of the latter are 
insufficient to pay a guarantee call and subject to the subsequent restoring of the amount transferred in accordance 
with the procedure set out in Article 212(4). 
The expenditure referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall cover, for each policy area, the 
items referred to in Article 47(4). 
Where the Commission transfers EAGF appropriations pursuant to the first subparagraph after 31 December, it shall take 
its decision by 31 January of the following financial year. The Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the 
Council within two weeks after its decision on those transfers. 
Three weeks before making the transfers referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph, the 
Commission shall inform the European Parliament and the Council of its intention to do so. In the event that duly 
justified objections are raised within that period by the European Parliament or by the Council, the procedure laid down 
in Article 31 shall apply. 
By way of derogation from the fourth subparagraph, the Commission may, during the last two months of the financial 
year, autonomously transfer appropriations concerning expenditure on staff, external personnel and other agents from 
one title to another within the total limit of 5 % of the appropriations for that year. The Commission shall inform the 
European Parliament and the Council within two weeks after its decision on those transfers. 
2. 
The Commission may, within its own section of the budget, decide on the following transfers of appropriations 
from one title to another, provided it immediately informs the European Parliament and the Council of its decision: 
(a) transfer of appropriations from the ‘provisions’ title referred to in Article 49 of this Regulation, where the only 
condition for lifting the reserve is the adoption of a basic act pursuant to Article 294 TFEU;
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/41
 
(b) in duly justified exceptional cases such as international humanitarian disasters and crises occurring after 1 December 
of the financial year, transfer of unused appropriations for that year still available in the titles falling under the 
heading of the multiannual financial framework dedicated to Union external action to the titles concerning crisis 
management aid and humanitarian aid operations. 
Article 31 
Transfer proposals submitted to the European Parliament and to the Council by Union institutions 
1. 
Each Union institution shall submit its transfer proposals simultaneously to the European Parliament and to the 
Council. 
2. 
The Commission may submit proposals for transfers of payment appropriations to the funds implemented under 
shared management with the exception of the EAGF to the European Parliament and to the Council by 10 January of the 
following financial year. The transfer of the payment appropriations may be made from any budgetary item. In such 
cases, the six-week period referred to in paragraph 4 shall be reduced to three weeks. 
If the transfer is not approved or only partially approved by the European Parliament and by the Council, the 
corresponding part of the expenditure referred to in point (b) of Article 10(5) shall be charged to the payment appropri­
ations of the following financial year. 
3. 
The European Parliament and the Council shall take decisions on transfers of appropriations in accordance with 
paragraphs 4 to 8. 
4. 
Except in urgent circumstances, the European Parliament and the Council, the latter acting by qualified majority, 
shall deliberate upon each transfer proposal within six weeks of its receipt by both institutions. In urgent circumstances, 
the European Parliament and the Council shall deliberate within three weeks of receipt of the proposal. 
5. 
Where the Commission intends to transfer EAGF appropriations in accordance with this Article, it shall submit 
transfer proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council by 10 January of the following financial year. In such 
cases, the six-week period referred to in paragraph 4 shall be reduced to three weeks. 
6. 
A transfer proposal shall be approved or considered to be approved, if, within the six-week period, any of the 
following occurs: 
(a) the European Parliament and the Council approve it; 
(b) either the European Parliament or the Council approves it and the other institution refrains from acting; 
(c) neither the European Parliament nor the Council takes a decision to amend or refuse the transfer proposal. 
7. 
Unless either the European Parliament or the Council requests otherwise, the six-week period referred to in 
paragraph 4 shall be reduced to three weeks in the following cases: 
(a) the transfer represents less than 10 % of the appropriations of the budget line from which the transfer is made and 
does not exceed EUR 5 000 000; 
(b) the transfer concerns only payment appropriations and the overall amount of the transfer does not exceed 
EUR 100 000 000.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the procedure set out in Article 31(3) and (4) shall apply. If the European Parliament 
and the Council do not agree to the Commission proposal and cannot reach a common position on the use of the 
Emergency Aid Reserve, they shall refrain from acting on that proposal. 
Proposals for transfers from the Emergency Aid Reserve shall be accompanied by appropriate and detailed supporting 
documents demonstrating:

CHAPTER 7 
Principle of sound financial management and performance 
Article 33 
Performance and principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness 
1. 
Appropriations shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, and thus be 
implemented respecting the following principles: 
(a) the principle of economy which requires that the resources used by the Union institution concerned in the pursuit of 
its activities shall be made available in due time, in appropriate quantity and quality, and at the best price; 
(b) the principle of efficiency which concerns the best relationship between the resources employed, the activities 
undertaken and the achievement of objectives; 
(c) the principle of effectiveness which concerns the extent to which the objectives pursued are achieved through the 
activities undertaken. 
2. 
In line with the principle of sound financial management, the use of appropriations shall focus on performance and 
for that purpose: 
(a) objectives for programmes and activities shall be established ex ante; 
(b) progress in the achievement of objectives shall be monitored with performance indicators; 
(c) progress in, and problems with, the achievement of objectives shall be reported to the European Parliament and to the 
Council in accordance with point (h) of the first subparagraph of Article 41(3) and with point (e) of Article 247(1). 
3. 
Specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound objectives as referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 and 
relevant, accepted, credible, easy and robust indicators shall be defined where relevant. 
Article 34 
Evaluations 
1. 
Programmes and activities which entail significant spending shall be subject to ex ante and retrospective evaluations, 
which shall be proportionate to the objectives and expenditure. 
2. 
Ex ante evaluations supporting the preparation of programmes and activities shall be based on evidence on the 
performance of related programmes or activities and shall identify and analyse the issues to be addressed, the added value 
of Union involvement, objectives, expected effects of different options and monitoring and evaluation arrangements. 
For major programmes or activities that are expected to have significant economic, environmental or social impacts, the 
ex ante evaluation may take the form of an impact assessment that, in addition to meeting the requirements set out in the 
first subparagraph, analyses the various options concerning the methods of implementation. 
3. 
Retrospective evaluations shall assess the performance of the programme or activity, including aspects such as 
effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, relevance and EU added value. Retrospective evaluations shall be based on the 
information generated by the monitoring arrangements and indicators established for the action concerned. They shall 
be undertaken at least once during the term of every multiannual financial framework and where possible in sufficient 
time for the findings to be taken into account in ex ante evaluations or impact assessments which support the preparation 
of related programmes and activities.

estimates in terms of payment and commitment appropriations, by an assessment of the different financing options 
available, and by an ex ante evaluation or impact assessment as provided for in Article 34.

authority of the need for Union action. It shall provide appropriate information as regards coherence with other activities 
of the Union and any possible synergy. 
In the case of multiannual operations, the financial statement shall contain the foreseeable schedule of annual 
requirements in terms of commitment and payment appropriations and posts, including for external personnel, and

During the budgetary procedure, the Commission shall provide the necessary information for a comparison between 
changes in the appropriations required and the initial forecasts made in the financial statement in the light of the progress 
of deliberations on the proposal or initiative submitted to the legislative authority. 
3. 
In order to reduce the risk of fraud, irregularities and non-achievement of objectives, the financial statement shall 
provide information on the internal control system set up, an estimate of the costs and benefits of the controls implied 
by such a system and an assessment of the expected level of risk of error, as well as information on existing and planned 
fraud prevention and protection measures. 
Such assessment shall take into account the likely scale and type of errors, as well as the specific conditions of the policy 
area concerned and the rules applicable thereto.

involved in the control chain; 
(b) the accessibility for all appropriate actors in the control chain of the results of controls carried out; 
(c) reliance, where appropriate, on management declarations of implementation partners and on independent audit 
opinions, provided that the quality of the underlying work is adequate and acceptable and that it was performed 
in accordance with agreed standards; 
(d) the timely application of corrective measures including, where appropriate, dissuasive penalties; 
(e) clear and unambiguous legislation underlying the policies concerned, including basic acts on the elements of the 
internal control; 
(f) the elimination of multiple controls; 
(g) the improvement of the cost benefit ratio of controls.

If, during implementation, the level of error is persistently high, the Commission shall identify the weaknesses in the 
control systems, analyse the costs and benefits of possible corrective measures and take or propose appropriate action, 
such as simplification of the applicable provisions, improvement of the control systems and redesign of the programme 
or delivery systems.

(b) separate sections for each Union institution, with the exception of the European Council and of the Council which 
shall share the same section, subdivided into statements of revenue and expenditure. 
Article 47 
Budget nomenclature 
1. 
Commission revenue and the revenue and expenditure of the other Union institutions shall be classified by the 
European Parliament and by the Council according to their type or the use to which they are assigned under titles, 
chapters, articles and items. 
2. 
The statement of expenditure for the section of the budget relating to the Commission shall be set out on the basis 
of a nomenclature adopted by the European Parliament and by the Council and classified according to the purpose of the 
expenditure. 
Each title shall correspond to a policy area and each chapter shall, as a rule, correspond to a programme or an activity. 
Each title may include operational appropriations and administrative appropriations. The administrative appropriations for 
a title shall be grouped in a single chapter. 
The budget nomenclature shall comply with the principles of specification, sound financial management and trans­
parency. It shall provide the clarity and transparency necessary for the budgetary process, facilitating the identification 
of the main objectives as reflected in the relevant legal bases, making choices on political priorities possible and enabling 
efficient and effective implementation. 
3. 
The Commission may request the addition of a token entry pro memoria on an entry without authorised appropri­
ations. Such a request shall be approved in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 31. 
4. 
When presented by purpose, administrative appropriations for individual titles shall be classified as follows: 
(a) expenditure on staff authorised in the establishment plan, which shall include an amount of appropriations and a 
number of establishment plan posts corresponding to that expenditure; 
(b) expenditure on external personnel and other expenditure referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 30(1) and financed under the ‘administration’ heading of the multiannual financial framework; 
(c) expenditure on buildings and other related expenditure, including cleaning and maintenance, rental and hiring, 
telecommunications, water, gas and electricity; 
(d) expenditure on external personnel and technical assistance directly linked to the implementation of programmes. 
Any administrative expenditure of the Commission of a type which is common to several titles shall be set out in a 
separate summary statement classified by type. 
Article 48 
Negative revenue 
1. 
The budget shall not contain negative revenue, except where it results from negative remuneration of deposits in 
total. 
2. 
The own resources paid under Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom shall be net amounts and shall be shown as such in 
the summary statement of revenue in the budget. 
Article 49 
Provisions 
1. 
Each section of the budget may include a ‘provisions’ title. Appropriations shall be entered in that title in any of the 
following cases: 
(a) no basic act exists for the action concerned when the budget is established; 
(b) there are serious grounds for doubting the adequacy of the appropriations or the possibility of implementing, under 
conditions in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, the appropriations entered on the budget 
lines concerned. 
The appropriations in that title may be used only after transfers in accordance with the procedure laid down in point (c) 
of the first subparagraph of Article 30(1) of this Regulation, where the adoption of the basic act is subject to the 
procedure laid down in Article 294 TFEU, and in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 31 of this 
Regulation, for all other cases.

on such transfers as provided for in Article 31. 
Article 50 
Negative reserve 
The section of the budget relating to the Commission may include a ‘negative reserve’ limited to a maximum amount of 
EUR 200 000 000. Such a reserve, which shall be entered in a separate title, shall comprise payment appropriations only.

CHAPTER 1 
General provisions 
Article 56 
Budget implementation in accordance with the principle of sound financial management 
1. 
The Commission shall implement the revenue and expenditure of the budget in accordance with this Regulation, 
under its own responsibility and within the limits of the appropriations authorised. 
2. 
The Member States shall cooperate with the Commission so that the appropriations are used in accordance with the 
principle of sound financial management. 
Article 57 
Information on transfers of personal data for audit purposes 
In any call made in the context of grants, procurement or prizes implemented under direct management, potential 
beneficiaries, candidates, tenderers and participants shall, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 be informed 
that, for the purposes of safeguarding the financial interests of the Union, their personal data may be transferred to 
internal audit services, to the Court of Auditors or to the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and between authorising 
officers of the Commission, and the executive agencies referred to in Article 69 of this Regulation and the Union bodies 
referred to in Articles 70 and 71 of this Regulation. 
Article 58 
Basic act and exceptions 
1. 
Appropriations entered in the budget for any Union action shall only be used if a basic act has been adopted. 
2. 
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, and subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5, the 
following appropriations may be implemented without a basic act provided the actions which they are intended to 
finance fall within the competences of the Union: 
(a) appropriations for pilot projects of an experimental nature designed to test the feasibility of an action and its 
usefulness; 
(b) appropriations for preparatory actions in the field of application of the TFEU and the Euratom Treaty, designed to 
prepare proposals with a view to the adoption of future actions; 
(c) appropriations for preparatory measures in the field of Title V of the TEU; 
(d) appropriations for one-off actions, or for actions for an indefinite duration, carried out by the Commission by virtue 
of tasks resulting from its prerogatives at institutional level pursuant to the TFEU and to the Euratom Treaty, other 
than its right of legislative initiative to submit proposals as referred to in point (b) of this paragraph, and under 
specific powers directly conferred on it by Articles 154, 156, 159 and 160 TFEU, Articles 168(2), 171(2) and 173(2) 
TFEU, the second paragraph of Article 175 TFEU, Article 181(2) TFEU, Article 190 TFEU and Articles 210(2) and 
214(6) TFEU and Articles 70 and 77 to 85 of the Euratom Treaty;
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/55
 
(e) appropriations for the operation of each Union institution under its administrative autonomy. 
3. 
With regard to appropriations referred to in point (a) of paragraph 2, the relevant commitment appropriations may 
be entered in the budget for not more than two consecutive financial years. The total amount of appropriations for pilot 
projects shall not exceed EUR 40 000 000 in any financial year. 
4. 
With regard to appropriations referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2, preparatory actions shall follow a coherent 
approach and may take various forms. The relevant commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget for not 
more than three consecutive financial years. The procedure for the adoption of the relevant basic act shall be concluded 
before the end of the third financial year. In the course of that procedure, the commitment of appropriations shall 
correspond to the particular features of the preparatory action with regard to the activities envisaged, the aims pursued 
and the recipients. As a result, the amount of the appropriations committed shall not correspond to the amount of those 
envisaged for financing the definitive action itself. 
The total amount of appropriations for new preparatory actions referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 shall not exceed 
EUR 50 000 000 in any financial year, and the total amount of appropriations actually committed for preparatory actions 
shall not exceed EUR 100 000 000. 
5. 
With regard to the appropriations referred to in point (c) of paragraph 2, preparatory measures shall be limited to a 
short period of time and shall be designed to establish the conditions for Union action in fulfilment of the objectives of 
the CFSP and for the adoption of the necessary legal instruments. 
For the purpose of Union crisis management operations, preparatory measures shall be designed, inter alia, to assess the 
operational requirements, to provide for a rapid initial deployment of resources, or to establish the conditions on the 
ground for the launching of the operation. Preparatory measures shall be agreed by the Council, on a proposal by the 
High Representative. 
In order to ensure the rapid implementation of preparatory measures, the High Representative shall inform the European 
Parliament and the Commission as early as possible of the Council’s intention to launch a preparatory measure and, in 
particular, of the estimated resources required for that purpose. The Commission shall take all the measures necessary to 
ensure a rapid disbursement of the funds. 
The financing of measures agreed by the Council for the preparation of Union crisis management operations under 
Title V TEU shall cover incremental costs directly arising from a specific field deployment of a mission or team involving, 
inter alia, personnel from Union institutions, including high-risk insurance, travel and accommodation costs and per diem 
payments. 
Article 59 
Budget implementation by Union institutions other than the Commission 
1. 
The Commission shall confer on the other Union institutions the requisite powers for the implementation of the 
sections of the budget relating to them. 
2. 
In order to facilitate the implementation of their appropriations, Union institutions may conclude service-level 
agreements with each other laying down the conditions governing the provision of services, supply of products, execution 
of works or of building contracts. 
Those agreements shall enable the transfer of appropriations or the recovery of costs, which result from their imple­
mentation. 
3. 
Service-level agreements referred to in paragraph 2 may also be agreed upon between departments of Union 
institutions, Union bodies, European offices, bodies or persons entrusted with implementation of specific actions in 
the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU and the Office of the Secretary-General of the Board of Governors of the 
European schools. The Commission and other Union institutions shall report regularly to the European Parliament and to 
the Council on the service-level agreements they conclude with other Union institutions. 
Article 60 
Delegation of budget implementation powers 
1. 
The Commission and each of the other Union institutions may, within their departments, delegate their powers of 
budget implementation in accordance with the conditions laid down in this Regulation and their internal rules and within 
the limits laid down in the instrument of delegation. Those so empowered shall act within the limits of the powers 
expressly conferred upon them.
EN 
L 193/56 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
2. 
In addition to paragraph 1, the Commission may delegate its powers of budget implementation concerning the 
operational appropriations of its own section of the budget to Heads of Union delegations and, in order to ensure 
business continuity during their absence, to deputy Heads of Union delegations. Such delegation shall be without 
prejudice to the responsibility of Heads of Union delegations for budget implementation. Where the absence of a 
Head of Union delegation exceeds four weeks, the Commission shall revise its decision to delegate powers of budget 
implementation. When Heads of Union delegations, and their deputies in the absence of the former, act as authorising 
officers by subdelegation of the Commission, they shall apply the Commission rules for budget implementation and shall 
be subject to the same duties, obligations and accountability as any other authorising officer by subdelegation of the 
Commission. 
The Commission may withdraw the delegation of powers referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with its own 
rules. 
For the purposes of the first subparagraph, the High Representative shall take the measures necessary to facilitate 
cooperation between Union delegations and Commission departments. 
3. 
The EEAS may exceptionally delegate its powers of budget implementation concerning the administrative appropri­
ations of its own section of the budget to Commission staff of Union delegations where this is necessary in order to 
ensure the continuity in the administration of such delegations in the absence of the EEAS competent authorising officer 
from the country where his or her delegation is based. In the exceptional cases where Commission staff of Union 
delegations act as authorising officers by subdelegation of the EEAS, they shall apply the EEAS internal rules for budget 
implementation and shall be subject to the same duties, obligations and accountability as any other authorising officer by 
subdelegation of the EEAS. 
The EEAS may withdraw the delegation of powers referred to in the first subparagraph in accordance with its own rules. 
Article 61 
Conflict of interests 
1. 
Financial actors within the meaning of Chapter 4 of this Title and other persons, including national authorities at 
any level, involved in budget implementation under direct, indirect and shared management, including acts preparatory 
thereto, audit or control, shall not take any action which may bring their own interests into conflict with those of the 
Union. They shall also take appropriate measures to prevent a conflict of interests from arising in the functions under 
their responsibility and to address situations which may objectively be perceived as a conflict of interests. 
2. 
Where there is a risk of a conflict of interests involving a member of staff of a national authority, the person in 
question shall refer the matter to his or her hierarchical superior. Where such a risk exists for staff covered by the Staff 
Regulations, the person in question shall refer the matter to the relevant authorising officer by delegation. The relevant 
hierarchical superior or the authorising officer by delegation shall confirm in writing whether a conflict of interests is 
found to exist. Where a conflict of interests is found to exist, the appointing authority or the relevant national authority 
shall ensure that the person in question ceases all activity in the matter. The relevant authorising officer by delegation or 
the relevant national authority shall ensure that any further appropriate action is taken in accordance with the applicable 
law. 
3. 
For the purposes of paragraph 1, a conflict of interests exists where the impartial and objective exercise of the 
functions of a financial actor or other person, as referred to in paragraph 1, is compromised for reasons involving family, 
emotional life, political or national affinity, economic interest or any other direct or indirect personal interest. 
CHAPTER 2 
Methods of implementation 
Article 62 
Methods of budget implementation 
1. 
The Commission shall implement the budget in any of the following ways: 
(a) directly (‘direct management’) as set out in Articles 125 to 153, by its departments, including its staff in the Union 
delegations under the authority of their respective Head of delegation, in accordance with Article 60(2), or through 
executive agencies as referred to in Article 69; 
(b) under shared management with Member States (‘shared management’) as set out in Articles 63 and 125 to 129;
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/57
 
(c) indirectly (‘indirect management’) as set out in Articles 125 to 149 and 154 to 159, where this is provided for in the 
basic act or in the cases referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 58(2), by entrusting budget implementation tasks to: 
(i) third countries or the bodies they have designated; 
(ii) international organisations or their agencies, within the meaning of Article 156; 
(iii) the European Investment Bank (‘the EIB’) or the European Investment Fund (‘the EIF’) or both of them acting as 
a group (‘the EIB group’); 
(iv) Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71; 
(v) public law bodies, including Member State organisations; 
(vi) bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, including Member State organisations, to the 
extent that they are provided with adequate financial guarantees; 
(vii) bodies governed by the private law of a Member State that are entrusted with the implementation of a public- 
private partnership and that are provided with adequate financial guarantees; 
(viii) bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the 
TEU, and identified in the relevant basic act. 
With regard to point (c)(vi) of the first subparagraph, the amount of the financial guarantees required may be set out in 
the relevant basic act and may be limited to the maximum amount of the Union contribution to the body concerned. In 
the case of multiple guarantors, the repartition of the amount of the total liability to be covered by the guarantees shall 
be specified in the contribution agreement, which may provide for the liability of each guarantor to be proportionate to 
the share of their respective contribution to the body. 
2. 
For the purposes of direct management, the Commission may use the instruments referred to in Titles VII, VIII, IX, 
X and XII. 
For the purposes of shared management, the instruments for budget implementation shall be the ones provided for in 
sector-specific rules. 
For the purposes of indirect management, the Commission shall apply Title VI and, in the case of financial instruments 
and budgetary guarantees, Titles VI and X. The implementing entities shall apply the instruments for budget implemen­
tation set out in the contribution agreement concerned. 
3. 
The Commission is responsible for budget implementation in accordance with Article 317 TFEU and shall not 
delegate those tasks to third parties, where such tasks involve a large measure of discretion implying political choices. 
The Commission shall not, through contracts in accordance with Title VII of this Regulation, outsource tasks involving 
the exercise of public authority and discretionary powers of judgement. 
Article 63 
Shared management with Member States 
1. 
Where the Commission implements the budget under shared management, tasks relating to budget implementation 
shall be delegated to Member States. The Commission and Member States shall respect the principles of sound financial 
management, transparency and non-discrimination and shall ensure the visibility of the Union action when they manage 
Union funds. To that end, the Commission and Member States shall fulfil their respective control and audit obligations 
and assume the resulting responsibilities laid down in this Regulation. Complementary provisions shall be laid down in 
sector-specific rules. 
2. 
When executing tasks relating to budget implementation, Member States shall take all the necessary measures, 
including legislative, regulatory and administrative measures, to protect the financial interests of the Union, namely by: 
(a) ensuring that actions financed from the budget are implemented correctly and effectively and in accordance with the 
applicable sector-specific rules; 
(b) designating bodies responsible for the management and control of Union funds in accordance with paragraph 3, and 
supervising such bodies;
EN 
L 193/58 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
(c) preventing, detecting and correcting irregularities and fraud; 
(d) cooperating, in accordance with this Regulation and sector-specific rules, with the Commission, OLAF, the Court of 
Auditors and, for those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Council Regulation (EU) 
2017/1939 ( 1 ), with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO). 
In order to protect the financial interests of the Union, Member States shall, while respecting the principle of propor­
tionality, and in compliance with this Article and the relevant sector-specific rules, carry out ex ante and ex post controls 
including, where appropriate, on-the-spot checks on representative and/or risk-based samples of transactions. They shall 
also recover funds unduly paid and bring legal proceedings where necessary in that regard. 
Member States shall impose effective, dissuasive and proportionate penalties on recipients where provided for in sector- 
specific rules or in specific provisions in national law. 
As part of its risk assessment and in accordance with sector-specific rules, the Commission shall monitor the 
management and control systems established in Member States. The Commission shall, in its audit work, respect the 
principle of proportionality and shall take into account the level of risk assessed in accordance with sector-specific rules. 
3. 
In accordance with the criteria and procedures laid down in sector-specific rules, Member States shall, at the 
appropriate level, designate bodies to be responsible for the management and control of Union funds. Such bodies 
may also carry out tasks not related to the management of Union funds and may entrust certain of their tasks to other 
bodies. 
When deciding on the designation of bodies, Member States may base their decision on whether the management and 
control systems are essentially the same as those already in place for the previous period and whether they have 
functioned effectively. 
If audit and control results show that the designated bodies no longer comply with the criteria set out in sector-specific 
rules, Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that deficiencies in the implementation of the tasks of 
those bodies are remedied, including by ending the designation in accordance with sector-specific rules. 
Sector-specific rules shall define the role of the Commission in the process set out in this paragraph. 
4. 
Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall: 
(a) set up and ensure the functioning of an effective and efficient internal control system; 
(b) use an accounting system that provides accurate, complete and reliable information in a timely manner; 
(c) provide the information required under paragraphs 5, 6 and 7; 
(d) ensure ex post publication in accordance with Article 38(2) to (6). 
Any processing of personal data shall comply with Regulation (EU) 2016/679. 
5. 
Bodies designated pursuant to paragraph 3 shall, by 15 February of the following financial year, provide the 
Commission with: 
(a) their accounts on the expenditure that was incurred, during the relevant reference period as defined in sector-specific 
rules, in the execution of their tasks and that was presented to the Commission for reimbursement; 
(b) an annual summary of the final audit reports and of controls carried out, including an analysis of the nature and 
extent of errors and weaknesses identified in systems, as well as corrective action taken or planned. 
6. 
The accounts referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 shall include pre-financing and sums for which recovery 
procedures are ongoing or have been completed. They shall be accompanied by a management declaration confirming 
that, in the opinion of those in charge of the management of the funds: 
(a) the information is properly presented, complete and accurate; 
(b) the expenditure was used for its intended purpose, as defined in sector-specific rules; 
(c) the control systems put in place ensure the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions.

7. 
The accounts referred to in point (a) of paragraph 5 and the summary referred to in point (b) of that paragraph 
shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted 
audit standards. That opinion shall establish whether the accounts give a true and fair view, whether expenditure for 
which reimbursement has been requested from the Commission is legal and regular, and whether the control systems put 
in place function properly. The opinion shall also state whether the audit work puts in doubt the assertions made in the 
management declaration referred to in paragraph 6. 
The deadline of 15 February set out in paragraph 5 may exceptionally be extended by the Commission to 1 March, upon 
communication by the Member State concerned. 
Member States may, at the appropriate level, publish the information referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 and in this 
paragraph. 
In addition, Member States may provide to the European Parliament, to the Council and to the Commission declarations 
signed at the appropriate level based on the information referred to in paragraphs 5 and 6 and in this paragraph. 
8. 
In order to ensure that Union funds are used in accordance with the applicable rules, the Commission shall: 
(a) apply procedures for the examination and acceptance of the accounts of the designated bodies, ensuring that the 
accounts are complete, accurate and true; 
(b) exclude from Union financing expenditure for which disbursements have been made in breach of applicable law; 
(c) interrupt payment deadlines or suspend payments where provided for in sector-specific rules. 
The Commission shall end all or part of the interruption of payment deadlines or suspension of payments after a Member 
State has presented its observations and as soon as it has taken any necessary measures. The annual activity report 
referred to in Article 74(9) shall cover all the obligations under this paragraph. 
9. 
Sector-specific rules shall take account of the needs of European Territorial Cooperation programmes as regards, in 
particular, the content of the management declaration, the process set out in paragraph 3 and the audit function. 
10. 
The Commission shall compile a register of bodies responsible for management, certification and audit activities 
under sector-specific rules.

Member States may use resources allocated to them under shared management in combination with operations 
and instruments carried out under Regulation (EU) 2015/1017 in accordance with the conditions set out in the relevant 
sector-specific rules.

The authorising officer shall be responsible in the Union institution concerned for implementing revenue and 
expenditure in accordance with the principle of sound financial management, including through ensuring reporting on 
performance, and for ensuring compliance with the requirements of legality and regularity and equal treatment of 
recipients. 
2. 
For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Article, the authorising officer by delegation shall, in accordance with 
Article 36 and the minimum standards adopted by each Union institution and having due regard to the risks associated 
with the management environment and the nature of the actions financed, put in place the organisational structure and 
the internal control systems suited to the performance of his or her duties. The establishment of such structure and 
systems shall be supported by a comprehensive risk analysis, which takes into account their cost effectiveness and 
performance considerations. 
3. 
To implement expenditure, the authorising officer responsible shall make budgetary and legal commitments, shall 
validate expenditure and authorise payments and shall undertake the preliminary steps for the implementation of 
appropriations. 
4. 
To implement revenue, the authorising officer responsible shall draw up estimates of amounts receivable, establish 
entitlements to be recovered and issue recovery orders. Where appropriate, the authorising officer responsible shall waive 
established entitlements. 
5. 
In order to prevent errors and irregularities before the authorisation of operations and to mitigate risks of non- 
achievement of objectives, each operation shall be subject at least to an ex ante control relating to the operational and 
financial aspects of the operation, on the basis of a multiannual control strategy which takes risk into account. 
The extent in terms of frequency and intensity of the ex ante controls shall be determined by the authorising officer 
responsible taking into account the results of prior controls as well as risk-based and cost-effectiveness considerations, on 
the basis of the authorising officer’s own risk analysis. In case of doubt, the authorising officer responsible for validating 
the relevant operations shall, as part of the ex ante control, request complementary information or perform an on-the-spot 
control in order to obtain reasonable assurance. 
For a given operation, the verification shall be carried out by staff other than those who initiated the operation. The staff 
who carry out the verification shall not be subordinate to the members of staff who initiated the operation. 
6. 
The authorising officer by delegation may put in place ex post controls to detect and correct errors and irregularities 
of operations after they have been authorised. Such controls may be organised on a sample basis according to risk and 
shall take account of the results of prior controls as well as cost-effectiveness and performance considerations. 
The ex post controls shall be carried out by staff other than those responsible for the ex ante controls. The staff responsible 
for the ex post controls shall not be subordinate to the members of staff responsible for the ex ante controls. 
The rules and modalities, including timeframes, for carrying out audits of the beneficiaries shall be clear, consistent and 
transparent, and shall be made available to the beneficiaries when signing the grant agreement. 
7. 
Authorising officers responsible and staff responsible for budget implementation shall have the necessary profes­
sional skills. 
In each Union institution, the authorising officer by delegation shall ensure the following: 
(a) that the authorising officers by subdelegation and their staff receive regularly updated and appropriate information 
and training concerning the control standards and the methods and techniques available for that purpose;
EN 
L 193/64 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
(b) that measures are taken, where needed, to ensure the effective and efficient functioning of the control systems in 
accordance with paragraph 2. 
8. 
If a member of staff, involved in the financial management and control of transactions, considers that a decision he 
or she is required by his or her superior to apply or to agree to is irregular or contrary to the principle of sound financial 
management or the professional rules which that member of staff is required to observe, he or she shall inform his or her 
hierarchical superior accordingly. If the member of staff does so in writing, the hierarchical superior shall reply in writing. 
If the hierarchical superior fails to take action or confirms the initial decision or instruction and the member of staff 
believes that such confirmation does not constitute a reasonable response to his or her concern, the member of staff shall 
inform the authorising officer by delegation in writing. If that officer does not reply within a reasonable time given the 
circumstances of the case and in any event within a month, the member of staff shall inform the relevant panel referred 
to in Article 143. 
In the event of any illegal activity, fraud or corruption which may harm the interests of the Union, the member of staff 
shall inform the authorities and bodies designated in the Staff Regulations and in the decisions of Union institutions 
concerning the terms and conditions for internal investigations in relation to the prevention of fraud, corruption and any 
other illegal activity detrimental to the interests of the Union. Contracts with external auditors carrying out audits of the 
financial management of the Union shall provide for an obligation of the external auditor to inform the authorising 
officer by delegation of any suspected illegal activity, fraud or corruption which may harm the interests of the Union. 
9. 
The authorising officer by delegation shall report to his or her Union institution on the performance of his or her 
duties in the form of an annual activity report containing financial and management information, including the results of 
controls, declaring that, except as otherwise specified in any reservations related to defined areas of revenue and expend­
iture, he or she has reasonable assurance that: 
(a) the information contained in the report presents a true and fair view; 
(b) the resources assigned to the activities described in the report have been used for their intended purpose and in 
accordance with the principle of sound financial management; and 
(c) the control procedures put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the 
underlying transactions. 
The annual activity report shall include information on the operations carried out, by reference to the objectives and 
performance considerations set in the strategic plans, the risks associated with those operations, the use made of the 
resources provided and the efficiency and effectiveness of internal control systems. The report shall include an overall 
assessment of the costs and benefits of controls and information on the extent to which the operational expenditure 
authorised contributes to the achievement of strategic objectives of the Union and generates EU added value. The 
Commission shall prepare a summary of the annual activity reports for the preceding year. 
The annual activity reports for the financial year of the authorising officers and, where applicable, authorising officers by 
delegation of Union institutions, Union bodies, European offices and agencies shall be published by 1 July of the 
following financial year on the website of the respective Union institution, Union body, European office or agency in 
an easily accessible way, subject to duly justified confidentiality and security considerations. 
10. 
The authorising officer by delegation shall, for each financial year, record contracts concluded by negotiated 
procedures in accordance with points (a) to (f) of point 11.1 and point 39 of Annex I. If the proportion of negotiated 
procedures in relation to the number of contracts awarded by the same authorising officer by delegation increases 
significantly in relation to earlier years or if that proportion is distinctly higher than the average recorded for the 
Union institution, the authorising officer responsible shall report to the Union institution setting out any measures 
taken to reverse that trend. Each Union institution shall send a report on negotiated procedures to the European 
Parliament and to the Council. In the case of the Commission, that report shall be annexed to the summary of the 
annual activity reports referred to in paragraph 9 of this Article. 
Article 75 
Keeping of supporting documents by authorising officers 
The authorising officer shall set up paper-based or electronic systems for the keeping of original supporting documents 
relating to budget implementation. Such documents shall be kept for at least five years from the date on which the 
European Parliament gives discharge for the financial year to which the documents relate. 
Without prejudice to the first paragraph, documents relating to operations shall in any case be kept until the end of the 
year following that in which those operations are definitively closed.

they shall be subject to the Commission as the Union institution responsible for the definition, exercise, monitoring and 
appraisal of their duties and responsibilities as authorising officers by subdelegation and shall cooperate closely with the 
Commission with regard to the proper implementation of the funds, in order to ensure, in particular, the legality and 
regularity of financial transactions, respect for the principle of sound financial management in the management of the 
funds and the effective protection of the financial interests of the Union. They shall be subject to the internal rules of the 
Commission and to the Commission Charter for the implementation of the financial management tasks subdelegated to 
them. They may be assisted in their duties by Commission staff of Union delegations. 
To this effect, Heads of Union delegations shall take the measures necessary to prevent any situation likely to put at risk 
the Commission’s capacity to fulfil its responsibility for budget implementation subdelegated to them, as well as any 
conflict of priorities which is likely to have an impact on the implementation of the financial management tasks 
subdelegated to them. 
Where a situation or conflict referred to in the second subparagraph arises, Heads of Union delegations shall without 
delay inform the Directors-General responsible of the Commission and of the EEAS thereof. Those Directors-General shall 
take appropriate steps to remedy the situation. 
2. 
If Heads of Union delegations find themselves in a situation as referred to in Article 74(8), they shall refer the 
matter to the panel referred to in Article 143. In the event of any illegal activity, fraud or corruption which may harm the 
interests of the Union, they shall inform the authorities and bodies designated by the applicable legislation. 
3. 
Heads of Union delegations acting as authorising officers by subdelegation in accordance with Article 60(2) shall 
report to their authorising officer by delegation so that the latter can integrate their reports in his or her annual activity 
report referred to in Article 74(9). The reports of Heads of Union delegations shall include information on the efficiency 
and effectiveness of internal control systems put in place in their delegation, as well as on the management of operations 
subdelegated to them, and provide the assurance referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 92(5). Those reports shall 
be annexed to the annual activity report of the authorising officer by delegation, and shall be made available to the 
European Parliament and to the Council having due regard, where appropriate, to their confidentiality. 
Heads of Union delegations shall fully cooperate with Union institutions involved in the discharge procedure and provide, 
as appropriate, any necessary additional information. In this context, they may be requested to attend meetings of the 
relevant bodies and assist the authorising officer by delegation responsible. 
Heads of Union delegations acting as authorising officers by subdelegation in accordance with Article 60(2) shall reply to 
any request by the authorising officer by delegation of the Commission at the Commission’s own request or, in the 
context of discharge, at the request of the European Parliament. 
The Commission shall ensure that the subdelegating of powers to Heads of Union delegations is not detrimental to the 
discharge procedure under Article 319 TFEU. 
4. 
Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall also apply to deputy Heads of Union delegations when they act as authorising officers 
by subdelegation in the absence of Heads of Union delegations.

Article 88 
Imprest accounts 
1. 
Imprest accounts may be set up for the payment of expenditure where, owing to the limited amounts involved, it is 
materially impossible or inefficient to carry out payment operations by budgetary procedures. Imprest accounts may also 
be set up for the collection of revenue other than own resources.
EN 
L 193/70 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
In Union delegations, imprest accounts may also be used to execute payments of limited amounts by budgetary 
procedures, if such use is efficient and effective due to local requirements. 
The maximum amount which may be paid by the imprest administrator where it is materially impossible or inefficient to 
carry out payment operations by budgetary procedures shall be established by the accounting officer and shall in any case 
not exceed EUR 60 000 for each item of expenditure. 
However, in the field of crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations, imprest accounts may be used without 
any limitation on the amount, while respecting the level of appropriations decided by the European Parliament and by the 
Council on the corresponding budget line for the current financial year and in accordance with the internal rules of the 
Commission. 
2. 
In Union delegations, imprest accounts shall be set up for the payment of expenditure from both the sections of the 
budget relating to the Commission and to the EEAS, ensuring full traceability of expenditure. 
Article 89 
Creation and administration of imprest accounts 
1. 
The creation of an imprest account and the appointment of an imprest administrator shall be the subject of a 
decision by the accounting officer of the Union institution, on the basis of a duly substantiated proposal from the 
authorising officer responsible. That decision shall set out the respective responsibilities and obligations of the imprest 
administrator and the authorising officer. 
Imprest administrators shall be chosen from officials or, should the need arise and only in duly substantiated cases, from 
other members of staff or in accordance with the conditions established in the internal rules of the Commission from 
personnel employed by the Commission in the field of crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations provided 
that their employment contracts guarantee equivalent level of protection in terms of liability as applicable to staff 
pursuant to Article 95. Imprest administrators shall be chosen on the grounds of their knowledge, skills and particular 
qualifications as evidenced by diplomas or by appropriate professional experience, or after an appropriate training 
programme. 
2. 
In proposals for decisions to create an imprest account, the authorising officer responsible shall ensure that: 
(a) priority is given to the use of budgetary procedures where there is access to the central computerised accounting 
system; 
(b) imprest accounts are used only in duly substantiated cases. 
In decisions to create an imprest account, the accounting officer shall specify the operating terms and the conditions for 
use of the imprest account. 
The amendment of the operating terms for an imprest account shall also be the subject of a decision by the accounting 
officer on a duly substantiated proposal from the authorising officer responsible. 
3. 
Bank accounts for the imprest shall be opened and monitored by the accounting officer, who shall also authorise 
delegated signatures on them on the basis of a duly substantiated proposal from the authorising officer responsible. 
4. 
Imprest accounts shall be endowed by the accounting officer of the Union institution and shall be placed under the 
responsibility of imprest administrators. 
5. 
Payments made shall be followed by formal final validation decisions or payment orders signed by the authorising 
officer responsible. 
The imprest transactions shall be settled by the authorising officer by the end of the following month, so that the 
accounting balance and the bank balance can be reconciled. 
6. 
The accounting officer shall carry out checks, or have them carried out by a staff member in his or her own 
department or in the authorising department specifically empowered for that purpose. Those checks shall as a general rule 
be effected on the spot and, where necessary, without warning, to verify the existence of the funds allocated to the 
imprest administrators and the bookkeeping and to check that imprest transactions are settled within the time limit set. 
The accounting officer shall communicate the findings of those checks to the authorising officer responsible.

1. 
Authorising officers responsible may at any time have their delegation or subdelegation withdrawn temporarily or 
definitively by the authority which appointed them. 
2. 
Accounting officers or imprest administrators, or both, may at any time be suspended temporarily or definitively 
from their duties by the authority which appointed them. 
3. 
Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be without prejudice to any disciplinary action taken in respect of the financial actors 
referred to in those paragraphs. 
Article 91 
Liability of financial actors for illegal activity, fraud or corruption 
1. 
This Chapter is without prejudice to any liability under criminal law which the financial actors referred to in 
Article 90 may incur as provided for in applicable national law and in the provisions in force concerning the protection 
of the financial interests of the Union and the fight against corruption involving Union officials or officials of Member 
States. 
2. 
Without prejudice to Articles 92, 94 and 95 of this Regulation, each authorising officer responsible, accounting 
officer or imprest administrator shall be liable to disciplinary action and payment of compensation as laid down in the 
Staff Regulations, or for the personnel employed by the Commission in the field of crisis management aid and humani­
tarian aid operations as referred to in Article 89(1) of this Regulation in their employment contracts. In the event of 
illegal activity, fraud or corruption which may harm the interests of the Union, the matter shall be referred to the 
authorities and bodies designated by the applicable legislation, in particular to OLAF.

Article 92 
Rules applicable to authorising officers 
1. 
The authorising officer responsible shall be liable for payment of compensation as laid down in the Staff Regu­
lations. 
2. 
The obligation to pay compensation shall apply in particular if the authorising officer responsible, whether inten­
tionally or through gross negligence on his or her part: 
(a) determines entitlements to be recovered or issues recovery orders, commits expenditure or signs a payment order 
without complying with this Regulation; 
(b) omits to draw up a document establishing an amount receivable, neglects to issue a recovery order or is late in 
issuing it or is late in issuing a payment order, thereby rendering the Union institution liable to civil action by third 
parties. 
3. 
An authorising officer by delegation or sub-delegation who receives a binding instruction which he or she considers 
to be irregular or contrary to the principle of sound financial management, in particular because the instruction cannot be 
carried out with the resources allocated to him or her, shall inform the authority from which he or she received the 
delegation or subdelegation about that fact in writing. If the instruction is confirmed in writing and that confirmation is 
received in good time and is sufficiently clear, in that it refers explicitly to the points which the authorising officer by 
delegation or subdelegation has challenged, the authorising officer by delegation or subdelegation shall not be held liable. 
He or she shall carry out the instruction, unless it is manifestly illegal or constitutes a breach of the relevant safety 
standards. 
The same procedure shall apply in cases where an authorising officer considers that a decision, which is his or her 
responsibility to take, is irregular or contrary to the principle of sound financial management or where an authorising 
officer learns, in the course of acting on a binding instruction, that the circumstances of the case could give rise to such a 
situation. 
Any instructions confirmed in the circumstances referred to in this paragraph shall be recorded by the authorising officer 
by delegation responsible and mentioned in his or her annual activity report.

4. 
In the event of subdelegation within his or her service, the authorising officer by delegation shall continue to be 
responsible for the efficiency and effectiveness of the internal management and control systems put in place and for the 
choice of the authorising officer by subdelegation. 
5. 
In the event of subdelegation to Heads of Union delegations and their deputies, the authorising officer by delegation 
shall be responsible for the definition of the internal management and control systems put in place, as well as their 
efficiency and effectiveness. Heads of Union delegations shall be responsible for the adequate setting up and functioning 
of those systems, in accordance with the instructions of the authorising officer by delegation, and for the management of 
the funds and the operations they carry out within the Union delegation under their responsibility. Before taking up their 
duties, they shall complete specific training courses on the tasks and responsibilities of authorising officers and budget 
implementation. 
Heads of Union delegations shall in accordance with Article 76(3) report on their responsibilities pursuant to the first 
subparagraph of this paragraph. 
Each year, Heads of Union delegations shall provide to the authorising officer by delegation of the Commission assurance 
on the internal management and control systems put in place in their delegation, as well as on the management of 
operations subdelegated to them, and the results thereof, in order to allow the authorising officer to make the statement 
of assurance provided for in Article 74(9). 
This paragraph shall also apply to deputy Heads of Union delegations when they act as authorising officers by subdel­
egation in the absence of Heads of Union delegations. 
Article 93 
Treatment of financial irregularities on the part of a member of staff 
1. 
Without prejudice to the powers of OLAF and to the administrative autonomy of Union institutions, Union bodies, 
European offices or bodies or persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title 
V of the TEU in respect of members of their staff and with due regard to the protection of whistle-blowers, any 
infringement of this Regulation, or of a provision relating to financial management or the checking of operations, 
resulting from an act or omission of a member of staff shall be referred for an opinion to the panel referred to in 
Article 143, by any of the following: 
(a) the appointing authority in charge of disciplinary matters; 
(b) the authorising officer responsible, including Heads of Union delegations and their deputies in their absence acting as 
authorising officers by subdelegation in accordance with Article 60(2). 
Where the panel is directly informed of a matter by a member of staff, it shall transmit the file to the appointing 
authority of the Union institution, Union body, European office or body or person concerned and shall inform the 
member of staff accordingly. The appointing authority may request the panel’s opinion on the case. 
2. 
A request for an opinion of the panel pursuant to the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 shall be accompanied by a 
description of the facts and the act or omission which the panel is asked to assess, as well as by relevant supporting 
documents, including reports of any investigation which has taken place. Wherever possible, the information shall be 
produced in anonymised form. 
Before submitting a request or any additional information to the panel, the appointing authority or the authorising 
officer, as appropriate, shall give the member of staff involved the opportunity to submit its observations, after having 
notified to him or her the supporting documents referred to in the first subparagraph, insofar as that notification does 
not seriously undermine the pursuit of further investigations. 
3. 
In the cases referred in paragraph 1 of this Article, the panel referred to in Article 143 shall be competent to assess 
whether, on the basis of the elements submitted to it pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article and any additional 
information received, a financial irregularity has occurred. On the basis of the opinion of the panel, the Union institution, 
Union body, European office or body or person concerned shall decide on the appropriate follow-up actions in 
accordance with the Staff Regulations. If the panel detects systemic problems, it shall make a recommendation to the 
authorising officer and to the authorising officer by delegation, unless the latter is the member of staff involved, as well as 
to the internal auditor. 
4. 
Where the panel gives the opinion referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall be composed of the members 
referred to in Article 143(2) as well as the following three additional members, which shall be appointed taking into 
account the need for avoiding any conflicts of interests: 
(a) a representative of the appointing authority in charge of disciplinary matters of the Union institution, Union body, 
European office or body or person concerned;

(b) a member appointed by the staff committee of the Union institution, Union body, European office or body or person 
concerned; 
(c) a member of the legal service of the Union institution employing the member of staff concerned. 
Where the panel gives the opinion referred to in paragraph 1, it shall be addressed to the appointing authority of the 
Union institution, Union body, European office or body or person concerned. 
5. 
The panel shall have no investigative powers. The Union institution, Union body, European office or body or 
person concerned shall cooperate with the panel with a view to ensuring that it has all the information necessary for 
giving its opinion. 
6. 
Where the panel considers that the case is a matter for OLAF, it shall in accordance with paragraph 1 transmit the 
file to the relevant appointing authority without delay and inform OLAF immediately. 
7. 
The Member States shall fully support the Union in the enforcement of any liability, under Article 22 of the Staff 
Regulations, of temporary staff to whom point (e) of Article 2 of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the 
European Union applies.

Article 97 
Estimate of amounts receivable 
1. 
When the authorising officer responsible has sufficient and reliable information in respect of any measure or 
situation which may give rise to an amount being owed to the Union, the authorising officer responsible shall make 
an estimate of the amount receivable. 
2. 
The estimate of the amount receivable shall be adjusted by the authorising officer responsible as soon as he or she is 
aware of an event modifying the measure or the situation which gave rise to the estimate being made. 
When establishing the recovery order on a measure or situation that had previously given rise to an estimate of amounts 
receivable, that estimate shall be adjusted accordingly by the authorising officer responsible. 
If the recovery order is drawn up for the same amount as the original estimate of amounts receivable, that estimate shall 
be reduced to zero. 
3. 
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, no estimate of the amount receivable shall be made before Member States 
make available to the Commission the amounts of own resources defined in Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom, which are 
paid at fixed intervals by Member States. The authorising officer responsible shall issue a recovery order in respect of 
those amounts.

Article 98 
Establishment of amounts receivable 
1. 
In order to establish an amount receivable, the authorising officer responsible shall: 
(a) verify that the debt exists; 
(b) determine or verify the reality and the amount of the debt; and 
(c) verify the conditions according to which the debt is due. 
The establishment of an amount receivable shall constitute recognition of the right of the Union in respect of a debtor 
and establishment of entitlement to demand that the debtor pay the debt. 
2. 
Any amount receivable that is identified as being certain, of a fixed amount and due shall be established by a 
recovery order by which the authorising officer responsible instructs the accounting officer to recover the amount. It shall 
be followed by a debit note sent to the debtor, except for the cases where a waiver procedure is carried out immediately 
in accordance with the second subparagraph of paragraph 4. Both the recovery order and the debit note shall be drawn 
up by the authorising officer responsible. 
The authorising officer shall send the debit note immediately after establishing the amount receivable and at the latest 
within a period of five years from the time when the Union institution was, in normal circumstances, in a position to 
claim its debt. Such period shall not apply where the authorising officer responsible establishes that, despite the efforts 
which the Union institution has made, the delay in acting was caused by the debtor’s conduct. 
3. 
To establish an amount receivable the authorising officer responsible shall ensure that: 
(a) the amount receivable is certain, meaning that it is not subject to any condition; 
(b) the amount receivable is fixed, expressed precisely in cash terms; 
(c) the amount receivable is due and is not subject to any payment time; 
(d) the particulars of the debtor are correct; 
(e) the amount is booked to the correct budgetary item; 
(f) the supporting documents are in order; and 
(g) the principle of sound financial management is complied with, in particular with regard to the criteria referred to in 
point (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 101(2). 
4. 
The debit note shall be to inform the debtor that: 
(a) the Union has established the amount receivable;
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/75
 
(b) if payment of the debt is made within the deadline, as specified in the debit note, no default interest will be due; 
(c) failing payment of the debt within the deadline referred to in point (b) of this subparagraph the debt shall bear 
interest at the rate referred to in Article 99, without any prejudice to any specific regulations applicable; 
(d) failing payment of the debt by the deadline referred to in point (b) the Union institution will effect recovery either by 
offsetting or by enforcement of any guarantee lodged in advance; 
(e) the accounting officer may in exceptional circumstances effect recovery by offsetting before the deadline referred to in 
point (b), where it is necessary to protect the financial interests of the Union when he or she has justified grounds to 
believe that the amount due to the Union would be lost, after the debtor has been informed of the reasons and date 
of the recovery by offsetting; 
(f) if, after taking all the steps set out in points (a) to (e) of this subparagraph, the amount has not been recovered in full, 
the Union institution will effect recovery by enforcement of a decision secured either in accordance with 
Article 100(2) or by legal action. 
Where following the verification of the particulars of the debtor or on the basis of other relevant information available at 
the time, it is clear that the debt falls under the cases referred to in point (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 101(2), or that the debit note has not been sent in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article, the authorising 
officer shall, after having established the amount receivable, decide to directly waive recovery in accordance with 
Article 101 without sending a debit note, in agreement with the accounting officer. 
In all other cases, the authorising officer shall print out the debit note and send it to the debtor. The accounting officer 
shall be informed of the dispatch of the debit note through the financial information system. 
5. 
Amounts wrongly paid shall be recovered. 
Article 99 
Default interest 
1. 
Without prejudice to any specific provisions deriving from the application of specific regulations, any amount 
receivable not repaid on the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 98(4) shall bear interest 
in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article. 
2. 
Except in the case referred to in paragraph 4 of this Article, the interest rate for amounts receivable not repaid on 
the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 98(4) shall be the rate applied by the European 
Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European 
Union, in force on the first calendar day of the month in which the deadline falls, increased by: 
(a) eight percentage points where the obligating event is a supply contract or a service contract; 
(b) three and a half percentage points in all other cases. 
3. 
Interest shall be calculated from the calendar day following the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first 
subparagraph of Article 98(4) up to the calendar day on which the debt is repaid in full. 
The recovery order corresponding to the amount of the default interest shall be issued when that interest is actually 
received. 
4. 
In the case of fines or other penalties, the interest rate for amounts receivable not paid within the deadline referred 
to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 98(4) shall be the rate applied by the European Central Bank to its 
principal refinancing operations, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union, in force on the 
first calendar day of the month in which the decision imposing a fine or other penalty has been adopted, increased by: 
(a) one and a half percentage points where the debtor provides a financial guarantee which is accepted by the accounting 
officer instead of payment; 
(b) three and a half percentage points in all other cases. 
Where the Court of Justice of the European Union, in the exercise of its competence under Article 261 TFEU, increases 
the amount of a fine or other penalty, interest on the amount of the increase shall run from the date of the judgment of 
the Court.

Article 100 
Authorisation of recovery 
1. 
The authorising officer responsible shall, by issuing a recovery order, instruct the accounting officer to recover an 
amount receivable which that authorising officer responsible has established (‘the authorisation of recovery’). 
2. 
A Union institution may formally establish an amount as being receivable from persons other than Member States 
by means of a decision which shall be enforceable within the meaning of Article 299 TFEU. 
If the efficient and timely protection of the financial interests of the Union so requires, other Union institutions may, in 
exceptional circumstances, request the Commission to adopt such an enforceable decision for their benefit with respect to 
claims arising in relation to staff or in relation to members or former members of a Union institution, provided that 
those institutions have agreed with the Commission on the practical modalities for the application of this Article. 
Such exceptional circumstances shall be deemed to exist when there is no prospect of recovery of the debt by the Union 
institution concerned by means of a voluntary payment or by means of offsetting as provided for in Article 101(1) and 
the conditions for waiving the recovery under Article 101(2) and (3) are not met. In all cases, the enforceable decision 
shall specify that the amounts claimed shall be entered in the section of the budget relating to the Union institution 
concerned, which shall act as authorising officer. The revenue shall be entered as general revenue except if it constitutes 
assigned revenue as provided for in Article 21(3). 
The requesting Union institution shall inform the Commission of any event likely to alter the recovery and shall intervene 
in support of the Commission in the event of an appeal against the enforceable decision.

Article 101 
Rules on recovery 
1. 
The accounting officer shall act on recovery orders for amounts receivable duly established by the authorising 
officer responsible. The accounting officer shall exercise due diligence to ensure that the Union receives its revenue and 
shall ensure that the Union’s rights are safeguarded. 
Partial reimbursement by a debtor who is subject to several recovery orders shall first be posted on the oldest entitlement 
unless otherwise specified by the debtor. Any partial payments shall first cover the interest. 
The accounting officer shall recover amounts due to the budget by offsetting them in accordance with Article 102. 
2. 
The authorising officer responsible may waive recovery of all or part of an established amount receivable only in the 
following cases: 
(a) where the foreseeable cost of recovery would exceed the amount to be recovered and the waiver would not harm the 
image of the Union; 
(b) where the amount receivable cannot be recovered in view of its age, of delay in the dispatch of the debit note in the 
terms defined in Article 98(2), of the insolvency of the debtor, or of any other insolvency proceedings; 
(c) where recovery is inconsistent with the principle of proportionality. 
Where the authorising officer responsible plans to waive or partially waive recovery of an established amount receivable, 
he or she shall ensure that the waiver is in order and is in accordance with the principles of sound financial management 
and proportionality. The decision to waive recovery shall be substantiated. The authorising officer may delegate the power 
to take that decision. 
3. 
In the case referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 2, the authorising officer responsible shall 
act in accordance with predetermined procedures established within his or her Union institution and shall apply the 
following criteria which are compulsory and applicable in all circumstances: 
(a) the facts, having regard to the gravity of the irregularity giving rise to the establishment of the amount receivable 
(fraud, repeated offence, intent, diligence, good faith, manifest error);
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/77
 
(b) the impact that waiving recovery would have on the operation of the Union and its financial interests (amount 
involved, risk of setting a precedent, undermining of the authority of the law). 
4. 
Depending on the circumstances of the case, the authorising officer responsible shall, where appropriate, take the 
following additional criteria into account: 
(a) any distortion of competition that would be caused by the waiving of recovery; 
(b) the economic and social damage that would be caused were the debt to be recovered in full. 
5. 
Each Union institution shall send to the European Parliament and to the Council each year a report on the waivers 
granted by it pursuant to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Article. Information on waivers below EUR 60 000 shall be 
provided as a total amount. In the case of the Commission, that report shall be annexed to the summary of the annual 
activity reports referred to in Article 74(9). 
6. 
The authorising officer responsible may cancel an established amount receivable in full or in part. The partial 
cancellation of an established amount receivable does not imply the waiver of the remaining established Union 
entitlement. 
In the event of a mistake, the authorising officer responsible shall cancel totally or partially the established amount 
receivable and include adequate reasons. 
Each Union institution shall in its internal rules lay down the conditions and procedure for delegating the power to 
cancel an established amount receivable. 
7. 
Member States shall have primary responsibility for carrying out controls and audits and for recovering amounts 
unduly spent, as provided for in sector-specific rules. To the extent that Member States detect and correct irregularities on 
their own account, they shall be exempt from financial corrections by the Commission concerning those irregularities. 
8. 
The Commission shall make financial corrections on Member States in order to exclude expenditure incurred in 
breach of applicable law from Union financing. The Commission shall base its financial corrections on the identification 
of amounts unduly spent, and the financial implications for the budget. Where such amounts cannot be identified 
precisely, the Commission may apply extrapolated or flat-rate corrections in accordance with sector-specific rules. 
The Commission shall, when deciding on the amount of a financial correction, take account of the nature and gravity of 
the breach of applicable law and the financial implications for the budget, including deficiencies in management and 
control systems. 
The criteria for establishing financial corrections and the procedure to be followed may be laid down in sector-specific 
rules. 
9. 
The methodology for applying extrapolated or flat-rate corrections shall be laid down in accordance with sector- 
specific rules with a view to enabling the Commission to protect the financial interests of the Union. 
Article 102 
Recovery by offsetting 
1. 
Where the debtor has a claim on the Union, or on an executive agency when it implements the budget, that is 
certain within the meaning of point (a) of Article 98(3), of a fixed amount and due relating to a sum established by a 
payment order, the accounting officer shall, after expiry of the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph 
of Article 98(4), recover established amounts receivable by offsetting. 
In exceptional circumstances, where it is necessary to safeguard the financial interests of the Union and where the 
accounting officer has justified grounds to believe that the amount due to the Union would be lost, the accounting officer 
may recover by offsetting before the expiry of the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 98(4). 
The accounting officer may also recover by offsetting before the expiry of the deadline referred to in point (b) of first 
subparagraph of Article 98(4) when the debtor agrees. 
2. 
Before proceeding with any recovery in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article, the accounting officer shall 
consult the authorising officer responsible and inform the debtors concerned, including of the means of redress in 
accordance with Article 133.
EN 
L 193/78 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
Where the debtor is a national authority or one of its administrative entities, the accounting officer shall also inform the 
Member State concerned of his or her intention to resort to recovery by offsetting at least 10 working days in advance of 
proceeding with it. However, in agreement with the Member State or administrative entity concerned, the accounting 
officer may proceed with the recovery by offsetting before that deadline has passed. 
3. 
The offsetting referred to in paragraph 1 shall have the same effect as a payment and discharge the Union for the 
amount of the debt and, where appropriate, of the interest due. 
Article 103 
Recovery procedure failing voluntary payment 
1. 
Without prejudice to Article 102, if the full amount has not been recovered by the deadline referred to in point (b) 
of the first subparagraph of Article 98(4), the accounting officer shall inform the authorising officer responsible and shall 
without delay launch the procedure for effecting recovery by any means offered by the law, including, where appropriate, 
by enforcement of any guarantee lodged in advance. 
2. 
Without prejudice to Article 102, where the recovery method referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article cannot be 
used and the debtor has failed to pay in response to a letter of formal notice sent by the accounting officer, the 
accounting officer shall effect recovery by enforcement of a decision secured either in accordance with Article 100(2) 
or by legal action. 
Article 104 
Additional time for payment 
The accounting officer may, in collaboration with the authorising officer responsible, allow additional time for payment 
only at the written request of the debtor, with due indication of the reasons, and provided that the following conditions 
are fulfilled: 
(a) the debtor undertakes to pay interest at the rate specified in Article 99 for the entire additional period allowed, 
starting from the deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 98(4); 
(b) in order to safeguard the rights of the Union, the debtor lodges a financial guarantee covering the debt outstanding in 
both the principal sum and the interest, which is accepted by the accounting officer of the Union institution. 
The guarantee referred to in point (b) of the first paragraph may be replaced by a joint and several guarantee by a third 
party approved by the accounting officer of the Union institution. 
In exceptional circumstances, following a request by the debtor, the accounting officer may waive the requirement of a 
guarantee referred to in point (b) of the first paragraph when, on the basis of his or her assessment, the debtor is willing 
and able to make the payment in the additional time period but is not able to lodge such guarantee and is in a situation 
of financial distress. 
Article 105 
Limitation period 
1. 
Without prejudice to the provisions of specific regulations and the application of Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom, 
entitlements of the Union in respect of third parties and entitlements of third parties in respect of the Union shall be 
subject to a limitation period of five years. 
2. 
The limitation period for entitlements of the Union in respect of third parties shall begin to run on the expiry of the 
deadline referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 98(4). 
The limitation period for entitlements of third parties in respect of the Union shall begin to run on the date on which the 
payment of the third party’s entitlement is due according to the corresponding legal commitment. 
3. 
The limitation period for entitlements of the Union in respect of third parties shall be interrupted by any act of a 
Union institution or a Member State acting at the request of a Union institution, notified to the third party and aiming at 
recovering the debt. 
The limitation period for entitlements of third parties in respect of the Union shall be interrupted by any act notified to 
the Union by its creditors or on behalf of its creditors aiming at recovering the debt. 
4. 
A new limitation period of five years shall begin to run on the day following the interruptions referred to in 
paragraph 3. 
5. 
Any legal action relating to an entitlement as referred to in paragraph 2, including actions brought before a court 
which later declares itself not to have jurisdiction, shall interrupt the limitation period. A new limitation period of five 
years shall not begin to run until a judgment having the force of res judicata is given or there is an extrajudicial 
settlement between the same parties on the same action.
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/79
 
6. 
Where the accounting officer allows the debtor additional time for payment in accordance with Article 104, this 
shall be considered as an interruption of the limitation period. A new limitation period of five years shall begin to run on 
the day following the expiry of the extended time for payment. 
7. 
Entitlements of the Union shall not be recovered after the expiry of the limitation period, as provided for in 
paragraphs 2 to 6. 
Article 106 
National treatment for entitlements of the Union 
In the event of insolvency proceedings, entitlements of the Union shall be given the same preferential treatment as 
entitlements of the same nature due to public bodies in Member States where the recovery proceedings are being 
conducted. 
Article 107 
Fines, other penalties, sanctions and accrued interest imposed by Union institutions 
1. 
Amounts received by way of fines, other penalties and sanctions, and any accrued interest or other income 
generated by them, shall not be entered in the budget as long as the decisions imposing them are or could still 
become subject to an appeal before the Court of Justice of the European Union. 
2. 
The amounts referred to in paragraph 1 shall be entered in the budget as soon as possible following the exhaustion 
of all legal remedies. Under duly justified exceptional circumstances or where the exhaustion of all legal remedies occurs 
after 1 September of the current financial year, the amounts may be entered in the budget in the following financial year. 
Amounts that are to be returned to the entity that paid them, following a judgment of the Court of Justice of the 
European Union, shall not be entered in the budget. 
3. 
Paragraph 1 shall not apply to decisions on clearance of accounts or financial corrections. 
Article 108 
Recovery of fines, other penalties or sanctions imposed by Union institutions 
1. 
Where an action is brought before the Court of Justice of the European Union against a decision of a Union 
institution imposing a fine, other penalty or sanction under the TFEU or the Euratom Treaty and until such time as all 
legal remedies have been exhausted, the debtor shall either provisionally pay the amounts concerned on the bank account 
designated by the accounting officer of the Commission or lodge a financial guarantee acceptable to the accounting 
officer of the Commission. The guarantee shall be independent of the obligation to pay the fine, other penalty or sanction 
and shall be enforceable on demand. It shall cover the claim as to principal and the interest due as specified in 
Article 99(4). 
2. 
The Commission shall secure the provisionally collected amounts by having them invested in financial assets, 
thereby ensuring the security and liquidity of the monies whilst also aiming at yielding a positive return. 
3. 
After the exhaustion of all legal remedies and where the fine, other penalty or sanction has been confirmed by the 
Court of Justice of the European Union, or where the decision imposing such a fine, other penalty or sanction may no 
longer become subject to an appeal before the Court of Justice of the European Union, one of the following measures 
shall be taken: 
(a) the provisionally collected amounts and the return on them shall be entered in the budget in accordance with 
Article 107(2); 
(b) where a financial guarantee has been lodged, it shall be enforced and the corresponding amounts entered in the 
budget. 
Where the amount of the fine, other penalty or sanction has been increased by the Court of Justice of the European 
Union, points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall apply up to the amounts of the original 
decision of the Union institution or, if applicable, to the amount laid down in a former judgment by the Court of Justice 
of the European Union in the same proceedings. The accounting officer of the Commission shall collect the amount 
corresponding to the increase and the interest due as specified in Article 99(4), which shall be entered in the budget. 
4. 
After all legal remedies have been exhausted and where the fine, other penalty or sanction has been cancelled or the 
amount has been reduced, one of the following measures shall be taken: 
(a) the provisionally collected amounts or, in the event of a reduction, the relevant part thereof, including any return, 
shall be repaid to the third party concerned;
EN 
L 193/80 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
(b) where a financial guarantee has been lodged, it shall be released accordingly. 
In the cases referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph, where the overall return on the provisionally collected 
amount is negative, the loss incurred shall be deducted from the amount to be repaid. 
Article 109 
Compensatory interests 
Without prejudice to Articles 99(2) and 116(5), and for cases other than fines, other penalties and sanctions as referred to 
in Articles 107 and 108, when an amount is to be reimbursed following a judgment of the Court of Justice of the 
European Union or as a result of an amicable settlement, the interest rate shall be the rate applied by the European 
Central Bank to its principal refinancing operations, as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European 
Union on the first calendar day of each month. The interest rate shall not be negative. The interest shall run from the date 
of payment of the amount to be reimbursed until the date at which the reimbursement is due. 
In cases where the overall interest rate would be negative it shall be set at zero percent. 
CHAPTER 7 
Expenditure operations 
Article 110 
Financing decisions 
1. 
A budgetary commitment shall be preceded by a financing decision adopted by the Union institution or by the 
authority to which powers have been delegated by the Union institution. The financing decisions shall be annual or 
multiannual. 
The first subparagraph of this paragraph shall not apply in the case of appropriations for the operations of each Union 
institution under its administrative autonomy that can be implemented without a basic act in accordance with point (e) of 
Article 58(2), of administrative support expenditure and of contributions to the Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 
and 71. 
2. 
The financing decision shall at the same time constitute the annual or multiannual work programme and shall be 
adopted, as appropriate, as soon as possible after the adoption of the draft budget and in principle no later than 31 
March of the year of implementation. Where the relevant basic act provides for specific modalities for the adoption of a 
financing decision or a work programme or both, those modalities shall be applied to the part of the financing decision 
constituting the work programme, in compliance with the requirements of that basic act. The part which constitutes the 
work programme shall be published on the website of the Union institution concerned immediately after its adoption and 
prior to its implementation. The financing decision shall indicate the total amount it covers and shall contain a 
description of the actions to be financed. It shall specify: 
(a) the basic act and the budget line; 
(b) the objectives pursued and the expected results; 
(c) the methods of implementation; 
(d) any additional information required by the basic act for the work programme. 
3. 
In addition to the elements referred to in paragraph 2, the financing decision shall set out the following: 
(a) for grants: the type of applicants targeted by the call for proposals or direct award and the global budgetary envelope 
reserved for the grants; 
(b) for procurement: the global budgetary envelope reserved for procurements; 
(c) for contributions to Union trust funds referred to in Article 234: the appropriations reserved for the trust fund for the 
year together with the amounts planned over its duration, from the budget as well as from other donors; 
(d) for prizes: the type of participants targeted by the contest, the global budgetary envelope reserved for the contest and 
a specific reference to prizes with a unit value of EUR 1 000 000 or more; 
(e) for financial instruments: the amount allocated to the financial instrument; 
(f) in the event of indirect management: the person or entity implementing Union funds pursuant to point (c) of the first 
subparagraph of Article 62(1) or the criteria to be used to select the person or entity;
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/81
 
(g) for contributions to blending facilities or platforms: the amount allocated to the blending facility or platform and the 
list of entities participating in the blending facility or platform; 
(h) for budgetary guarantees: the amount of annual provisioning and, where applicable, the amount of the budgetary 
guarantee to be released. 
4. 
The authorising officer by delegation may add any additional information considered appropriate either in the 
respective financing decision constituting the work programme or in any other document published on the website of the 
Union institution. 
A multiannual financing decision shall be consistent with the financial programming referred to in Article 41(2) and shall 
specify that the implementation of the decision is subject to the availability of budget appropriations for the respective 
financial years after the adoption of the budget or as provided for in the system of provisional twelfths. 
5. 
Without prejudice to any specific provision of a basic act, any substantial change in a financing decision already 
adopted shall follow the same procedure as the initial decision. 
Article 111 
Expenditure operations 
1. 
Every item of expenditure shall be committed, validated, authorised and paid. 
At the end of the periods referred to in Article 114, the unused balance of budgetary commitments shall be decommitted. 
When executing operations, the authorising officer responsible shall ensure that the expenditure is in compliance with the 
Treaties, the budget, this Regulation, and other acts adopted pursuant to the Treaties as well as with the principle of 
sound financial management. 
2. 
Budgetary commitments shall be made and legal commitments entered into by the same authorising officer, except 
in duly justified cases. In particular, in the field of crisis management aid and humanitarian aid operations, legal 
commitments may be entered into by Heads of Union delegations, or in their absence by their deputies, on the 
instruction of the authorising officer responsible of the Commission who remains fully responsible, however, for the 
underlying transaction. The personnel employed by the Commission in the field of crisis management aid and humani­
tarian aid operations may sign legal commitments linked to payments executed from imprest accounts of a value not 
exceeding EUR 2 500. 
The authorising officer responsible shall make a budgetary commitment before entering into a legal commitment with 
third parties or transferring funds to a Union trust fund referred to in Article 234. 
The second subparagraph of this paragraph shall not apply: 
(a) to legal commitments concluded following a declaration of a crisis situation in the framework of a business 
continuity plan, in accordance with the procedures adopted by the Commission or by any other Union institution 
under its administrative autonomy; 
(b) in the case of humanitarian aid operations, civil protection operations and crisis management aid, if efficient delivery 
of the Union’s intervention requires that the Union enter into a legal commitment with third parties immediately and 
if prior booking of the individual budgetary commitment is not possible. 
In the cases referred to in point (b) of the third subparagraph, the budgetary commitment shall be booked without delay 
after entering into a legal commitment with third parties. 
3. 
The authorising officer responsible shall validate expenditure by accepting that an item of expenditure is charged to 
the budget, after having checked the supporting documents attesting the creditor’s entitlement as per the conditions set in 
the legal commitment when there is a legal commitment. For that purpose, the authorising officer responsible shall: 
(a) verify the existence of the creditor’s entitlement; 
(b) determine or verify the reality and the amount of the claim through the endorsement ‘certified correct’; 
(c) verify the conditions according to which payment is due. 
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, the validation of expenditure shall also apply to interim or final reports not 
associated with a payment request in which case the impact on the accounting system is limited to the general accounts. 
4. 
The validation decision shall be expressed through electronically secured signature in accordance with Article 146 
by the authorising officer, or by a technically competent member of staff duly empowered by a formal decision of the 
authorising officer, or, exceptionally, for paper workflow take the form of a stamp incorporating that signature.
EN 
L 193/82 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
With the endorsement ‘certified correct’ the authorising officer responsible, or a technically competent member of staff 
duly empowered by the authorising officer responsible, shall certify: 
(a) for pre-financing: that the conditions required in the legal commitment for the payment of the pre-financing are met; 
(b) for interim and balance payments in contracts: that the services provided for in the contract have been properly 
provided, the supplies properly delivered or that the work has been properly carried out; 
(c) for interim and balance payments in grants: that the action or work programme carried out by the beneficiary is in all 
respects in compliance with the grant agreement, including, where applicable that the costs declared by the bene­
ficiary are eligible. 
In the case referred to in point (c) of the second subparagraph, cost estimates shall not be deemed to comply with the 
eligibility conditions set out in Article 186(3). The same principle shall also apply to interim and final reports not 
associated to a payment request. 
5. 
In order to authorise the expenditure, the authorising officer responsible shall, after having verified that the 
appropriations are available, issue a payment order to instruct the accounting officer to pay the amount of expenditure 
which was previously validated. 
Where periodic payments are made with regard to services rendered, including rental services, or goods delivered, the 
authorising officer may, subject to that officer’s risk analysis, order the application of a direct debit system from an 
imprest account. The application of such a system may also be ordered if it is specifically authorised by the accounting 
officer in accordance with Article 86(3). 
Article 112 
Types of budgetary commitments 
1. 
Budgetary commitments shall fall into one of the following categories: 
(a) individual: when the recipient and the amount of the expenditure are known; 
(b) global: when at least one of the elements necessary to identify the individual commitment is still not known; 
(c) provisional: to cover routine management expenditure for the EAGF as referred to in Article 11(2), and routine 
administrative expenditure where either the amount or the final payees are not definitively known. 
Notwithstanding point (c) of the first subparagraph, routine administrative expenditure relating to Union delegations and 
Union representations may be covered by provisional budgetary commitments also when the amount and final payee are 
known. 
2. 
Budgetary commitments for actions extending over more than one financial year may be broken down over several 
years into annual instalments only where the basic act so provides or where they relate to administrative expenditure. 
3. 
A global budgetary commitment shall be made on the basis of a financing decision. 
The global budgetary commitment shall be made at the latest before the decision on the recipients and amounts is taken 
and, where implementation of the appropriations concerned involves the adoption of a work programme, at the earliest 
after that programme has been adopted. 
4. 
A global budgetary commitment shall be implemented either by the conclusion of a financing agreement, itself 
providing for the subsequent entering into one or more legal commitments, or by entering into one or more legal 
commitments. 
Financing agreements in the field of direct financial assistance to third countries, including budget support, which 
constitute legal commitments may give rise to payments without entering into other legal commitments. 
Where the global budgetary commitment is implemented by the conclusion of a financing agreement, the second 
subparagraph of paragraph 3 shall not apply. 
5. 
Each individual legal commitment entered into following a global budgetary commitment shall, prior to signature, 
be registered by the authorising officer responsible in the central budgetary accounts and booked to the global budgetary 
commitment.
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/83
 
6. 
Provisional budgetary commitments shall be implemented by entering into one or more legal commitments giving 
rise to an entitlement to subsequent payments. However, in cases relating to expenditure on staff management, 
expenditure on members or former members of a Union institution or expenditure on communication engaged in by 
Union institutions for the coverage of Union events, or in the cases referred to in point 14.5 of Annex I, they may be 
implemented directly by payments without entering into prior legal commitments. 
Article 113 
Commitments for EAGF appropriations 
1. 
For each financial year, the EAGF appropriations shall include non-differentiated appropriations for expenditure 
related to measures referred to in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. Expenditure related to the measures 
referred to in Article 4(2) and Article 6 of that Regulation, with the exception of measures financed under non-oper­
ational technical assistance and contributions to executive agencies, shall be covered by differentiated appropriations. 
2. 
The Commission decisions fixing the amount of reimbursement of expenditure related to the EAGF incurred by 
Member States shall constitute global provisional budgetary commitments, which shall not exceed the total appropri­
ations entered in the budget for the EAGF. 
3. 
Global provisional budgetary commitments for the EAGF which have been made for a financial year and which 
have not given rise to a commitment on specific budget lines by 1 February of the following financial year shall be 
decommitted in respect of the financial year concerned. 
4. 
Expenditure effected by the authorities and bodies referred to in the rules relating to the EAGF shall, within two 
months of receipt of the statements sent by Member States, be the subject of a commitment by chapter, article and item. 
Such commitments may be made after the expiry of that two-month period where a procedure for a transfer of 
appropriations concerning the relevant budget lines is necessary. Except where payment has not yet been made by 
Member States or where eligibility is in doubt, the amounts shall be charged as payments within the same two-month 
period. 
The commitments referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be deducted from the global provisional 
budgetary commitment referred to in paragraph 1. 
5. 
Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall apply subject to the examination and acceptance of the accounts. 
Article 114 
Time limits for commitments 
1. 
Without prejudice to Articles 111(2) and 264(3), legal commitments relating to individual or provisional budgetary 
commitments shall be entered into by 31 December of year n, year n being the one in which the budgetary commitment 
was made. 
2. 
Global budgetary commitments shall cover the total cost of the corresponding legal commitments entered into up 
to 31 December of year n+1. 
Where the global budgetary commitment gives rise to the award of a prize referred to in Title IX, the legal commitment 
referred to in Article 207(4) shall be entered into by 31 December of year n+3. 
In external actions, where the global budgetary commitment gives rise to a financing agreement concluded with a third 
country, the financing agreement shall be concluded by 31 December of year n+1. In that case, the global budgetary 
commitment shall cover the total costs of legal commitments implementing the financing agreement entered into within 
a period of three years following the date of conclusion of the financing agreement. 
However, in the following cases, the global budgetary commitment shall cover the total costs of legal commitments 
entered into until the end of the period of implementation of the financing agreement: 
(a) multi-donor actions; 
(b) blending operations; 
(c) legal commitments relating to audit and evaluation; 
(d) the following exceptional circumstances: 
(i) modifications made to legal commitments which have already been entered into;
EN 
L 193/84 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
(ii) legal commitments that are to be entered into after early termination of an existing legal commitment; 
(iii) changes of the implementing entity. 
3. 
The third and fourth subparagraphs of paragraph 2 shall not apply to the following multiannual programmes that 
are implemented through split commitments: 
(a) the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance established by Regulation (EU) No 231/2014 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council ( 1 ); 
(b) the European Neighbourhood Instrument established by Regulation (EU) No 232/2014 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council ( 2 ). 
In the cases referred to in the first subparagraph, the appropriations shall be automatically decommitted by the 
Commission in accordance with sector-specific rules. 
4. 
The individual and provisional budgetary commitments for actions extending over more than one financial year 
shall, except in the case of staff expenditure, have a final date for implementation set, in accordance with the conditions

on the approval of a report or a certificate; 
(c) 30 calendar days for all other contribution agreements, contracts and grant agreements.

The time allowed for making payments shall be understood to include validation, authorisation and the payment of 
expenditure.

3. 
A payment request shall be registered by the authorised department of the authorising officer responsible as soon as 
possible and is deemed to be received on the date it is registered. 
The date of payment is deemed to be the date on which the Union institution’s account is debited. 
A payment request shall include the following essential elements: 
(a) the creditor’s identification; 
(b) the amount; 
(c) the currency; 
(d) the date. 
Where at least one essential element is missing, the payment request shall be rejected. 
The creditor shall be informed in writing of a rejection and the reasons for it as soon as possible and in any case within 
30 calendar days from the date on which the payment request was received. 
4. 
The authorising officer responsible may suspend the time limit for payment where: 
(a) the amount of the payment request is not due; or 
(b) the appropriate supporting documents have not been produced. 
If information comes to the notice of the authorising officer responsible which puts in doubt the eligibility of expenditure 
in a payment request, he or she may suspend the time limit for payment for the purpose of verifying, including by means 
of on-the-spot-checks, that the expenditure is eligible. The remaining time allowed for payment shall begin to run from 
the date on which the requested information or revised documents are received or the necessary further verification, 
including on-the-spot checks, is carried out. 
The creditors concerned shall be informed in writing of the reasons for a suspension.

(b) the interest shall be payable for the period elapsing from the calendar day following expiry of the time limit for 
payment laid down in paragraph 1 up to the day of payment.

6. 
Each Union institution shall submit to the European Parliament and Council a report on the compliance with and 
the suspension of the time limits laid down in paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article. The report of the Commission shall be

shall be registered in the database referred to in Article 142(1). Where such decisions are taken on the basis of 
Article 136(4), the information registered in the database shall include the information concerning the persons 
referred to in that paragraph. 
4. 
The decision to exclude persons or entities referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article or to impose financial penalties 
on a recipient shall be based on a final judgment or, in the exclusion situations referred to in Article 136(1), on a final 
administrative decision, or on a preliminary classification in law by the panel referred to in Article 143 in the situations 
referred to in Article 136(2) in order to ensure a centralised assessment of those situations. In the cases referred to in 
Article 141(1), the authorising officer responsible shall reject a participant from a given award procedure.

(f) it has been established by a final judgment or final administrative decision that the person or entity has committed an

(h) it has been established by a final judgment or final administrative decision that an entity has been created with the

2. 
In the absence of a final judgment or, where applicable, a final administrative decision in the cases referred to in 
points (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article, or in the case referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1 of this

preliminary classification in law of a conduct as referred to in those points, having regard to established facts or other 
findings contained in the recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 143. 
The preliminary classification referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph does not prejudge the assessment of 
the conduct of the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) concerned by the competent authorities of Member 
States under national law. The authorising officer responsible shall review his or her decision to exclude the person or 
entity referred to in Article 135(2) and/or to impose a financial penalty on a recipient without delay following the 
notification of a final judgment or a final administrative decision. In cases where the final judgment or the final 
administrative decision does not set the duration of the exclusion, the authorising officer responsible shall set that 
duration on the basis of established facts and findings and having regard to the recommendation of the panel 
referred to in Article 143. 
Where such final judgment or final administrative decision holds that the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) is 
not guilty of the conduct subject to a preliminary classification in law, on the basis of which that person or entity has 
been excluded, the authorising officer responsible shall, without delay, bring an end to that exclusion and/or reimburse, as 
appropriate, any financial penalty imposed. 
The facts and findings referred to in the first subparagraph shall include, in particular: 
(a) facts established in the context of audits or investigations carried out by EPPO in respect of those Member States 
participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the Court of Auditors, OLAF or the

authority relating to the infringement of Union or national competition law. 
3. 
Any decision of the authorising officer responsible taken under Articles 135 to 142 or, where applicable, any 
recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 143, shall be made in compliance with the principle of propor­
tionality, in particular taking into account: 
(a) the seriousness of the situation, including the impact on the financial interests and image of the Union; 
(b) the time which has elapsed since the relevant conduct; 
(c) the duration of the conduct and its recurrence; 
(d) whether the conduct was intentional or the degree of negligence shown; 
(e) in the cases referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1, whether a limited amount is at stake; 
(f) any other mitigating circumstances, such as: 
(i) the degree of collaboration of the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) concerned with the relevant 
competent authority and the contribution of that person or entity to the investigation as recognised by the 
authorising officer responsible; or 
(ii) the disclosure of the exclusion situation by means of a declaration as referred to in Article 137(1). 
4. 
The authorising officer responsible shall exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) where: 
(a) a natural or legal person who is a member of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the person or 
entity referred to in Article 135(2), or who has powers of representation, decision or control with regard to that 
person or entity, is in one or more of the situations referred to in points (c) to (h) of paragraph 1 of this Article; 
(b) a natural or legal person that assumes unlimited liability for the debts of the person or entity referred to in

(c) a natural person who is essential for the award or for the implementation of the legal commitment is in one or more 
of the situations referred to in points (c) to (h) of paragraph 1. 
5. 
In the cases referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the authorising officer responsible may exclude a person or 
entity referred to in Article 135(2) provisionally without the prior recommendation of the panel referred to in 
Article 143, where their participation in an award procedure or their selection for implementing Union funds would 
constitute a serious and imminent threat to the financial interests of the Union. In such cases, the authorising officer 
responsible shall immediately refer the case to the panel referred to in Article 143 and shall take a final decision no later 
than 14 days after having received the recommendation of the panel. 
6. 
The authorising officer responsible, having regard, where applicable, to the recommendation of the panel referred to 
in Article 143, shall not exclude a person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) from participating in an award procedure 
or from being selected for implementing Union funds where: 
(a) the person or entity has taken remedial measures as specified in paragraph 7 of this Article, to an extent that is 
sufficient to demonstrate its reliability. This point shall not apply in the case referred to in point (d) of paragraph 1 of 
this Article; 
(b) it is indispensable to ensure the continuity of service, for a limited duration and pending the adoption of remedial 
measures specified in paragraph 7 of this Article; 
(c) such an exclusion would be disproportionate on the basis of the criteria referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article.

In addition, point (a) of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply in the case of the purchase of supplies on particularly 
advantageous terms from either a supplier which is definitively winding up its business activities or the liquidators in an 
insolvency procedure, an arrangement with creditors, or a similar procedure under Union or national law. 
In the cases of non-exclusion referred to in the first and second subparagraphs of this paragraph, the authorising officer 
responsible shall specify the reasons for not excluding the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) and inform the 
panel referred to in Article 143 of those reasons. 
7. 
The remedial measures referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 6 shall include, in particular: 
(a) measures to identify the origin of the situations giving rise to exclusion and concrete technical, organisational and 
personnel measures within the relevant business or activity area of the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2), 
appropriate to correct the conduct and prevent its further occurrence; 
(b) proof that the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) has undertaken measures to compensate or redress the 
damage or harm caused to the financial interests of the Union by the underlying facts giving rise to the exclusion 
situation; 
(c) proof that the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) has paid or secured the payment of any fine imposed by 
the competent authority or of any taxes or social security contributions referred to in point (b) of paragraph 1 of this 
Article. 
8. 
The authorising officer responsible, having regard, where applicable, to the revised recommendation of the panel 
referred to in Article 143, shall, without delay, revise its decision to exclude a person or entity referred to in 
Article 135(2) ex officio or on request from that person or entity, where the latter has taken remedial measures sufficient 
to demonstrate its reliability or has provided new elements demonstrating that the exclusion situation referred to in 
paragraph 1 of this Article no longer exists. 
9. 
In the case referred to in point (b) of Article 135(2), the authorising officer responsible shall require that the 
candidate or tenderer replaces an entity or a subcontractor on whose capacity it intends to rely, which is in an exclusion 
situation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article. 
Article 137 
Declaration and evidence of absence of an exclusion situation 
1. 
A participant shall declare whether it is in one of the situations referred to in Articles 136(1) and 141(1), and, 
where applicable, whether it has taken any remedial measures referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 136(6). 
A participant shall also declare whether the following persons or entities are in one of the exclusion situations referred to 
in points (c) to (h) of Article 136(1): 
(a) natural or legal persons that are members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the participant 
or that have powers of representation, decision or control with regard to that participant; 
(b) beneficial owners, as defined in point (6) of Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2015/849, of the participant. 
The participant or the recipient shall without delay inform the authorising officer responsible of any changes in the 
situations as declared. 
Where appropriate, the candidate or tenderer shall provide the same declarations referred to in the first and second 
subparagraphs signed by a subcontractor or by any other entity on whose capacity it intends to rely, as the case may be. 
The authorising officer responsible shall not request the declarations referred to in the first and second subparagraph 
when such declarations have already been submitted for the purposes of another award procedure, provided that the 
situation has not changed, and that the time that has elapsed since the issuing date of the declarations does not exceed 
one year. 
The authorising officer responsible may waive the requirements under the first and second subparagraphs for very low 
value contracts the value of which does not exceed the amount referred to in point 14.4 of Annex I.

2. 
Whenever requested by the authorising officer responsible and where this is necessary to ensure the proper conduct 
of the procedure, the participant, the subcontractor or the entity on whose capacity a candidate or tenderer intends to 
rely shall provide: 
(a) appropriate evidence that it is not in one of the exclusion situations referred to in Article 136(1); 
(b) information on natural or legal persons that are members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of 
the participant or that have powers of representation, decision or control with regard to that participant, including 
persons and entities within the ownership and control structure and beneficial owners, and appropriate evidence that 
none of those persons are in one of the exclusion situations referred to in points (c) to (f) of Article 136(1). 
(c) appropriate evidence that natural or legal persons that assume unlimited liability for the debts of that participant are 
not in an exclusion situation referred to in point (a) or (b) of Article 136(1). 
3. 
Where applicable and in accordance with national law, the authorising officer responsible may accept as appropriate 
evidence that a participant or an entity referred to in paragraph 2 is not in one of the exclusion situations referred to in 
points (a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of Article 136(1), a recent extract from the judicial record or, failing that, an equivalent 
document recently issued by a judicial or administrative authority in its country of establishment showing that those 
requirements are satisfied. 
The authorising officer responsible may accept as appropriate evidence that a participant or an entity referred to in 
paragraph 2 is not in one of the exclusion situations referred to in points (a) and (b) of Article 136(1), a recent certificate 
issued by the competent authority of the country of establishment. Where such types of certificates are not issued in the 
country of establishment, the participant may provide a sworn statement made before a judicial authority or notary or, 
failing that, a solemn statement made before an administrative authority or a qualified professional body in its country of 
establishment. 
4. 
The authorising officer responsible shall waive the obligation of a participant or an entity referred to in paragraph 2 
to submit the documentary evidence referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3: 
(a) if he or she can access such evidence on a national database free of charge; 
(b) if such evidence has already been submitted for the purposes of another procedure and provided that any submitted 
documents are still valid and that the time that has elapsed since the issuing date of the documents does not exceed 
one year; 
(c) if he or she recognises that there is a material impossibility to provide such evidence. 
5. 
Paragraphs 1 to 4 of this Article shall not apply to persons and entities implementing Union funds pursuant to 
point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) or to Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71. 
For financial instruments and in the absence of rules and procedures fully equivalent to those referred to in point (d) of 
the first subparagraph of Article 154(4), final recipients and intermediaries shall provide the person or entity imple­
menting Union funds pursuant to point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) with a signed declaration on honour 
confirming that they are not in one of the situations referred to in points (a) to (d), (g) and (h) of Article 136(1) or points 
(b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 141(1) or in a situation deemed equivalent following the assessment carried 
out in accordance with Article 154(4). 
Where, exceptionally, financial instruments are implemented pursuant to point (a) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 62(1), final recipients shall provide financial intermediaries with a signed declaration on honour confirming 
that they are not in one of the situations referred to in points (a) to (d), (g) and (h) of Article 136(1) or points (b) 
and (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 141(1). 
Article 138 
Financial penalties 
1. 
In order to ensure a deterrent effect, the authorising officer responsible may, having regard, where applicable, to the 
recommendation of the panel referred to in Article 143, impose a financial penalty on a recipient with whom a legal 
commitment has been entered into and who is in an exclusion situation referred to in point (c), (d), (e) or (f) of 
Article 136(1). 
Regarding the exclusion situations referred to in points (c) to (f) of Article 136(1), the financial penalty may be imposed 
as an alternative to a decision to exclude a recipient, where such an exclusion would be disproportionate on the basis of 
the criteria referred to in Article 136(3).
EN 
L 193/98 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
Regarding the exclusion situations referred to in points (c), (d) and (e) of Article 136(1), the financial penalty may be 
imposed in addition to an exclusion where this is necessary to protect the financial interests of the Union, due to the 
systemic and recurrent conduct engaged in by the recipient with the intention to unduly obtain Union funds. 
Notwithstanding the first, second and third subparagraphs of this paragraph, a financial penalty shall not be imposed on a 
recipient who in accordance with Article 137 has disclosed that it is in an exclusion situation. 
2. 
The amount of the financial penalty shall not exceed 10 % of the total value of the legal commitment. In the event 
of a grant agreement signed with a number of beneficiaries the financial penalty shall not exceed 10 % of the grant 
amount the beneficiary concerned is entitled to in accordance with the grant agreement. 
Article 139 
Duration of exclusion and limitation period 
1. 
The duration of exclusion shall not exceed any of the following: 
(a) the duration, if any, set by the final judgement or the final administrative decision of a Member State; 
(b) in the absence of a final judgment or a final administrative decision: 
(i) five years for the cases referred to in point (d) of Article 136(1); 
(ii) three years for the cases referred to in points (c) and (e) to (h) of Article 136(1). 
A person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) shall be excluded as long as it is in one of the exclusion situations referred 
to in points (a) and (b) of Article 136(1). 
2. 
The limitation period for excluding and/or imposing financial penalties on a person or entity referred to 
Article 135(2) shall be five years calculated from any of the following: 
(a) the date of the conduct giving rise to exclusion or, in the case of continued or repeated acts, the date on which the 
conduct ceases, in the cases referred to in points (b) to (e) and (g) and (h) of Article 136(1); 
(b) the date of the final judgment of a national jurisdiction or of the final administrative decision in the cases referred to 
in points (b), (c), (d), (g) and (h) of Article 136(1). 
The limitation period shall be interrupted by an act of a national authority, of the Commission, of OLAF, of EPPO in 
respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, of the 
panel referred to in Article 143 of this Regulation or of any entity involved in budget implementation, if such an act is 
notified to the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) of this Regulation and is relating to investigations or judicial 
proceedings. A new limitation period shall begin to run on the day following the interruption. 
For the purpose of point (f) of Article 136(1) of this Regulation, the limitation period to exclude a person or entity 
referred to in Article 135(2) of this Regulation and/or impose financial penalties on a recipient provided for in Article 3 
of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 shall apply. 
Where the conduct of a person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) of this Regulation concerned qualifies under several 
of the grounds listed in Article 136(1) of this Regulation, the limitation period applicable to the most serious of those 
grounds shall apply. 
Article 140 
Publication of exclusion and financial penalties 
1. 
In order to, where necessary, reinforce the deterrent effect of the exclusion and/or financial penalty, the Commission 
shall, subject to a decision of the authorising officer responsible, publish on its website the following information related 
to the exclusion and, where applicable, the financial penalty in the cases referred to in points (c) to (h) of Article 136(1): 
(a) the name of the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) concerned; 
(b) the exclusion situation; 
(c) the duration of the exclusion and/or the amount of the financial penalty.
EN

Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/99
 
Where the decision on the exclusion and/or financial penalty has been taken on the basis of a preliminary classification as 
referred to in Article 136(2), the publication shall indicate that there is no final judgment or, where applicable, final 
administrative decision. In such cases, information about any appeals, their status and their outcome, as well as any 
revised decision of the authorising officer responsible shall be published without delay. Where a financial penalty has 
been imposed, the publication shall also indicate whether that penalty has been paid. 
The decision to publish the information shall be taken by the authorising officer responsible either following the relevant 
final judgment or, where applicable, final administrative decision, or following the recommendation of the panel referred 
to in Article 143, as the case may be. That decision shall take effect three months after its notification to the person or 
entity concerned, as referred to in Article 135(2). 
The information published shall be removed as soon as the exclusion has come to an end. In the case of a financial 
penalty, the publication shall be removed six months after payment of that penalty. 
Where personal data are concerned, the authorising officer responsible shall in accordance with Regulation (EC) 
No 45/2001 inform the person or entity concerned, as referred to in Article 135(2) of this Regulation, of their rights 
under the applicable data protection rules and of the procedures available for exercising those rights. 
2. 
The information referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not be published in any of the following circum­
stances: 
(a) where it is necessary to preserve the confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings; 
(b) where publication would cause disproportionate damage to the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) 
concerned or would otherwise be disproportionate on the basis of the proportionality criteria set out in Article 136(3) 
and having regard to the amount of the financial penalty; 
(c) where a natural person is concerned, unless the publication of personal data is justified by exceptional circumstances, 
inter alia, by the seriousness of the conduct or its impact on the financial interests of the Union. In such cases, the 
decision to publish the information shall duly take into consideration the right to privacy and other rights provided 
for in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001. 
Article 141 
Rejection from an award procedure 
1. 
The authorising officer responsible shall reject from an award procedure a participant who: 
(a) is in an exclusion situation established in accordance with Article 136; 
(b) has misrepresented the information required as a condition for participating in the procedure or has failed to supply 
that information; 
(c) was previously involved in the preparation of documents used in the award procedure where this entails a breach of 
the principle of equality of treatment, including distortion of competition, that cannot be remedied otherwise. 
The authorising officer responsible shall communicate to the other participants in the award procedure the relevant 
information exchanged in the context of or resulting from the involvement of the participant in the preparation of the 
award procedure as referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph. Prior to any such rejection the participant shall be 
given the opportunity to prove that its involvement in preparing the award procedure does not breach the principle of 
equality of treatment. 
2. 
Article 133(1) shall apply unless the rejection has been justified in accordance with point (a) of the first 
subparagraph of paragraph 1 of this Article by a decision concerning exclusion taken with regard to the participant, 
following an examination of its observations. 
Article 142 
The early-detection and exclusion system

Information exchanged within the early-detection and exclusion system referred to in Article 135 shall be 
centralised in a database set up by the Commission (‘the database’) and shall be managed in accordance with the 
right to privacy and other rights provided for in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.

Information on cases of early detection, exclusion and/or financial penalties shall be entered in the database by the 
authorising officer responsible after notifying the person or entity concerned, as referred to in Article 135(2). Such 
notification may be deferred in exceptional circumstances, where there are compelling legitimate grounds to preserve 
the confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial proceedings, until such compelling legitimate grounds to 
preserve the confidentiality cease to exist. 
In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, the Commission shall upon request inform the person or entity subject 
to the early-detection and exclusion system, as referred to in Article 135(2), of the data stored in the database relating to 
that person or entity. 
The information contained in the database shall be updated, where appropriate, following a rectification, an erasure or 
any modification of data. It shall only be published in accordance with Article 140. 
2. 
The early-detection and exclusion system shall be based on facts and findings as referred to in the fourth 
subparagraph of Article 136(2) and on the transmission of information to the Commission, in particular, by: 
(a) EPPO in respect of those Member States participating in enhanced cooperation pursuant to Regulation (EU) 
2017/1939, or OLAF in accordance with Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013 where an investigation 
completed or in progress shows that it might be appropriate to take precautionary measures or actions to protect 
the financial interests of the Union, with due regard to the respect for procedural and fundamental rights, and to the 
protection of whistle-blowers; 
(b) an authorising officer of the Commission, of a European office set up by the Commission or of an executive agency; 
(c) a Union institution, a European office, an agency other than those referred to in point (b) of this paragraph, or a body 
or a person entrusted with implementation of CFSP actions; 
(d) entities implementing the budget in accordance with Article 63, in cases of detected fraud and/or irregularity and their 
follow up, where the transmission of information is required by sector-specific rules; 
(e) persons or entities implementing Union funds pursuant to point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1), in cases 
of detected fraud and/or irregularity and their follow up. 
3. 
Except where information is to be submitted in accordance with sector-specific rules, the information to be 
transmitted pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Article shall include: 
(a) the identification of the entity or person concerned; 
(b) a summary of the risks detected or the facts in question; 
(c) information that could assist the authorising officer in carrying out the verification referred to in paragraph 4 of this 
Article or in taking a decision on exclusion as referred to in Article 136(1) or (2), or a decision to impose a financial 
penalty as referred to in Article 138; 
(d) where applicable, information on any special measures necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the information 
transmitted, including measures for the safeguarding of evidence to protect the investigation or the national judicial 
proceedings. 
4. 
The Commission shall without delay transmit the information referred to in paragraph 3 to its authorising officers 
and those of its executive agencies, all other Union institutions, Union bodies, European offices and agencies through the 
database referred to in paragraph 1 in order to allow them to carry out the necessary verification in respect of their 
ongoing award procedures and existing legal commitments. 
In carrying out that verification, the authorising officer responsible shall exercise his or her powers as set out in Article 74 
and shall not go beyond what is foreseen in the terms and conditions of the award procedure and legal commitments. 
The retention period for the information related to the early detection transmitted in accordance with paragraph 3 of this 
Article shall not exceed one year. If, during that period, the authorising officer responsible requests the panel to issue a 
recommendation in a case concerning exclusion or financial penalties, the retention period may be extended until such 
time as the authorising officer responsible has taken a decision. 
5. 
All persons and entities involved in budget implementation in accordance with Article 62 shall be granted access by 
the Commission to the information on decisions on exclusion pursuant to Article 136 to enable them to verify whether 
there is an exclusion in the system with a view to taking this information into account, as appropriate and on their own 
responsibility, when awarding contracts in budget implementation.

The panel shall uphold the right of the person or entity concerned, as referred to in Article 135(2), to submit 
observations on the facts or findings referred to in Article 136(2) and on the preliminary classification in law before 
adopting its recommendations. The right to submit observations may be deferred in exceptional circumstances where 
there are compelling legitimate grounds to preserve the confidentiality of an investigation or of national judicial 
proceedings, until such legitimate grounds cease to exist. 
6. 
The recommendation of the panel to exclude and/or impose a financial penalty shall, where applicable, contain the 
following elements: 
(a) the facts or findings referred to in Article 136(2) and their preliminary classification in law; 
(b) an assessment of the need to impose a financial penalty and its amount; 
(c) an assessment of the need to exclude the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) and, in that case, the suggested 
duration of such an exclusion; 
(d) an assessment of the need to publish the information related to the person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) who 
is excluded and/or subject to a financial penalty; 
(e) an assessment of remedial measures taken by the person or entity referred to Article 135(2), if any. 
Where the authorising officer responsible envisages taking a more severe decision than what has been recommended by 
the panel, he or she shall ensure that such a decision is taken with due respect for the right to be heard and for the rules 
of personal data protection.

such decision to the panel. 
7. 
The panel shall revise its recommendation during the exclusion period on request from the authorising officer 
responsible in the cases referred to in Article 136(8) or following the notification of a final judgment or a final adminis­
trative decision establishing the grounds for exclusion where such a judgment or decision does not set the duration of the 
exclusion, as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 136(2). 
8. 
The panel shall notify the requesting authorising officer without delay of its revised recommendation, following 
which the authorising officer shall review his or her decision. 
9. 
The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have unlimited jurisdiction to review a decision whereby the 
authorising officer excludes a person or entity referred to in Article 135(2) and/or imposes a financial penalty on a 
recipient, including annulling the exclusion, reducing or increasing its duration and/or annulling, reducing or increasing 
the financial penalty imposed. Article 22(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 shall not apply when the decision of the 
authorising officer to exclude or impose a financial penalty is taken on the basis of a recommendation of the panel. 
Article 144 
Functioning of the database for the early-detection and exclusion system 
1. 
Information requested from the entities referred to in point (d) of Article 142(2) shall be transmitted only through

(‘the Irregularity Management System’), in accordance with sector-specific rules. 
2. 
The use of the data received through the Irregularity Management System shall take into consideration the status of 
the national procedure that existed at the time when the information was submitted. Such use shall be preceded by a 
consultation of the Member State that has submitted the relevant data through the Irregularity Management System.

Article 146 
Electronic management of operations 
1. 
Where revenue and expenditure operations or document exchanges are managed by means of computer systems, 
documents may be signed by a computerised or electronic procedure providing authentication of the signatory. Such 
computer systems shall include a full and up-to-date description of the system defining the content of all data fields, 
describing how each individual operation is treated and explaining in detail how the computer system guarantees the 
existence of a complete audit trail for each operation.

Subject to the prior agreement of the Union institutions and Member States concerned, any transmission of 
documents between them may be done by electronic means. 
Article 147 
e-Government 
1. 
Union institutions, the executive agencies and the Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 shall establish and 
apply uniform standards for the electronic exchange of information with participants. In particular, they shall, to the 
greatest possible extent, design and implement solutions for the submission, storage and processing of data submitted in 
award procedures, and to that end, put in place a single ‘electronic data interchange area’ for participants. The 
Commission shall report regularly to the European Parliament and to the Council on the progress made in that regard. 
2. 
Under shared management, all official exchanges of information between Member States and the Commission shall 
be carried out by means indicated in sector-specific rules. Those rules shall provide for interoperability of data gathered or 
received, and transmitted in the management of the budget.

Article 152 
Guarantees 
1. 
With the exception of contracts and grants the value of which does not exceed EUR 60 000, the authorising officer 
responsible may, if proportionate and subject to the authorising officer’s risk analysis, require a guarantee to be lodged: 
(a) by contractors or beneficiaries in order to limit the financial risks connected with a payment of pre-financing 
(‘guarantee on pre-financing’); 
(b) by contractors to ensure compliance with substantial contractual obligations in the case of works, supplies or 
complex services (‘performance guarantee’); 
(c) by contractors to ensure full performance of the contract during the contract liability period (‘retention money 
guarantee’). 
The JRC shall be exempted from lodging guarantees. 
As an alternative to requesting a guarantee on pre-financing, for grants, the authorising officer responsible may decide to 
split the payment into several instalments. 
2. 
The authorising officer responsible shall decide whether the guarantee is to be denominated in euro or in the 
currency of the contract or of the grant agreement. 
3. 
The guarantee shall be issued by a bank or by an authorised financial institution accepted by the authorising officer 
responsible. 
At the request of the contractor or the beneficiary and provided it is accepted by the authorising officer responsible: 
(a) the guarantees referred to points (a), (b) and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 may be replaced by a joint 
and several guarantee of the contractor or the beneficiary and a third party; 
(b) the guarantee referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 may be replaced by an irrevocable and 
unconditional joint guarantee of the beneficiaries who are parties to the same grant agreement. 
4. 
The guarantee shall have the effect of making the bank or financial institution or the third party provide irrevocable 
collateral security, or stand as first-call guarantor of the contractor’s or beneficiary’s obligations. 
5. 
Where, in the course of implementation of the contract or the grant agreement, the authorising officer responsible 
discovers that a guarantor is not or is no longer authorised to issue guarantees in accordance with the applicable national 
law, he or she shall require that the contractor or the beneficiary replaces the guarantee issued by such a guarantor. 
Article 153 
Guarantee on pre-financing 
1. 
A guarantee on pre-financing shall be for an amount not exceeding the amount of the pre-financing and shall be 
valid for a period sufficiently long to allow it to be activated. 
2. 
The guarantee on pre-financing shall be released as and when the pre-financing is deducted from interim payments 
or payments of the balance to the contractor or the beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the contract or the 
conditions of the grant agreement. 
TITLE VI 
INDIRECT MANAGEMENT 
Article 154 
Indirect management 
1. 
The selection of the persons and entities to be entrusted with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary 
guarantees pursuant to point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) shall be transparent, justified by the nature of 
the action and shall not give rise to a conflict of interests. For entities referred to in points (c)(ii), (v), (vi) and (vii) of the 
first subparagraph of Article 62(1) the selection shall also take due account of their financial and operational capacity. 
Where the person or entity is identified in a basic act, the financial statement provided for in Article 35 shall include a 
justification for the choice of that particular person or entity.
EN 
L 193/106 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
In cases of implementation by a network, requiring the designation of at least one body or entity per Member State or 
per country concerned, the body or entity shall be designated by the Member State or the country concerned in 
accordance with the basic act. In all other cases, the Commission shall designate such bodies or entities in agreement 
with Member States or countries concerned. 
2. 
Persons and entities entrusted with the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees pursuant to point 
(c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) shall respect the principles of sound financial management, transparency, 
non-discrimination and visibility of Union action. Where the Commission establishes financial framework partnership 
agreements in accordance with Article 130 those principles shall be further described in such agreements. 
3. 
Prior to signing contribution agreements, financing agreements or guarantee agreements, the Commission shall 
ensure a level of protection of the financial interests of the Union equivalent to the one that is provided for when the 
Commission implements the budget in accordance with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1). The 
Commission shall do so by carrying out an assessment of the systems, rules and procedures of the persons or 
entities implementing Union funds, if it intends to rely on such systems, rules and procedures for the implementation 
of the action, or by taking appropriate supervisory measures in accordance with paragraph 5 of this Article. 
4. 
The Commission shall, in accordance with the principle of proportionality and with due consideration for the 
nature of the action and the financial risks involved, assess that persons and entities implementing Union funds pursuant 
to point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1): 
(a) set up and ensure the functioning of an effective and efficient internal control system based on international best 
practices and allowing in particular to prevent, detect and correct irregularities and fraud; 
(b) use an accounting system that provides accurate, complete and reliable information in a timely manner; 
(c) are subject to an independent external audit, performed in accordance with internationally accepted auditing standards 
by an audit service functionally independent of the person or entity concerned; 
(d) apply appropriate rules and procedures for providing financing to third parties, including transparent, non-discrimi­
natory, efficient and effective review procedures, rules for recovering funds unduly paid and rules for excluding from 
access to funding; 
(e) make public adequate information on their recipients equivalent to that provided for under Article 38; 
(f) ensure protection of personal data equivalent to that referred to in Article 5. 
In addition, in agreement with the persons or entities concerned, the Commission may assess other rules and procedures 
such as the costs of administrating the accounting practices of the persons or entities. On the basis on the results of that 
assessment, the Commission may decide to rely on those rules and procedures. 
Persons or entities which have been assessed in accordance with the first and second subparagraphs shall inform the 
Commission without undue delay if any substantive changes are made to their systems, rules or procedures which may 
impact the reliability of the Commission’s assessment. 
5. 
Where the persons or entities concerned comply only in part with paragraph 4, the Commission shall take 
appropriate supervisory measures ensuring the protection of the financial interests of the Union. Those measures shall 
be specified in the relevant agreements. Information about any such measures shall be made available to the European 
Parliament and to the Council at their request. 
6. 
The Commission may decide not to require an ex ante assessment as referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4: 
(a) for Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71 and for bodies or persons referred to in point (c)(viii) of the first 
subparagraph of Article 62(1) which have adopted financial rules with prior consent of the Commission; 
(b) for third countries or the bodies they designate, in so far as the Commission retains financial management respon­
sibilities that guarantee a sufficient protection of the financial interests of the Union; or 
(c) for those procedures specifically required by the Commission, including its own and those specified in basic acts.

7. 
Where the systems, rules or procedures of the persons or entities referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 62(1) are assessed as appropriate, Union contributions to those persons or entities may be implemented in 
accordance with this Title. Where such persons or entities participate in a call for proposals they shall comply with 
the rules of the call for proposals contained in Title VIII. In such a case, the authorising officer may decide to sign a 
contribution agreement or a financing agreement instead of a grant agreement. 
Article 155 
Implementation of Union funds and budgetary guarantees 
1. 
Persons and entities implementing Union funds or budgetary guarantees shall provide the Commission with: 
(a) a report on the implementation of Union funds or budgetary guarantees, including the fulfilment of the conditions or 
the achievement of results referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(1); 
(b) where the contribution reimburses expenditure, their accounts drawn up for the expenditure incurred; 
(c) a management declaration covering the information referred to in point (a) and, where appropriate, point (b) 
confirming that: 
(i) the information is properly presented, complete and accurate; 
(ii) the Union funds were used for their intended purpose, as defined in the contribution agreements, financing 
agreements or guarantee agreements, or where applicable, in the relevant sector-specific rules; 
(iii) the control systems put in place give the necessary guarantees concerning the legality and regularity of the 
underlying transactions; 
(d) a summary of the final audit reports and of controls carried out, including an analysis of the nature and extent of 
errors and weaknesses identified in systems, as well as corrective action taken or planned. 
Where cross-reliance on audits as referred to in Article 127 takes place, the summary referred to in point (d) of the first 
subparagraph of this paragraph shall include all relevant audit documentation to be relied upon. 
For actions terminating before the end of the financial year concerned, the final report may replace the management 
declaration referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph, provided it is submitted before 15 February of the following 
financial year. 
The documents referred to in the first subparagraph shall be accompanied by an opinion of an independent audit body, 
drawn up in accordance with internationally accepted audit standards. That opinion shall establish whether the control 
systems put in place function properly and are cost-effective, and whether the underlying transactions are legal and 
regular. The opinion shall also state whether the audit work puts in doubt the assertions made in the management 
declaration referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph. Where such an opinion is absent, the authorising officer may 
seek an equivalent level of assurance through other independent means. 
The documents referred to in the first subparagraph shall be provided to the Commission no later than 15 February of 
the following financial year. The opinion referred to in the third subparagraph shall be provided to the Commission no 
later than 15 March of that year. 
The obligations set out in this paragraph shall be without prejudice to agreements concluded with the EIB, the EIF, 
Member State organisations, international organisations and third countries. With regard to the management declaration, 
such agreements shall include at least the obligation of those entities to provide the Commission annually with a 
statement that, during the financial year concerned, the Union funds were used and accounted for in compliance with 
Article 154(3) and (4) and with the obligations laid down in such agreements. Such statement may be incorporated in the 
final report if the action implemented is limited to 18 months. 
2. 
When implementing Union funds, persons and entities shall: 
(a) comply with applicable Union law and agreed international and Union standards and, therefore, not support actions 
that contribute to money laundering, terrorism financing, tax avoidance, tax fraud or tax evasion;
EN 
L 193/108 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
(b) when implementing financial instruments and budgetary guarantees in accordance with Title X, not enter into new or 
renewed operations with entities incorporated or established in jurisdictions listed under the relevant Union policy on 
non-cooperative jurisdictions or that are identified as high-risk third countries pursuant to Article 9(2) of Directive 
(EU) 2015/849, or that do not effectively comply with Union or internationally agreed tax standards on transparency 
and exchange of information. 
Entities may derogate from point (b) of the first subparagraph only if the action is physically implemented in one of those 
jurisdictions, and does not present any indication that the relevant operation falls under any of the categories listed in 
point (a) of the first subparagraph. 
When concluding agreements with financial intermediaries, entities implementing financial instruments and budgetary 
guarantees in accordance with Title X shall transpose the requirements referred to in this paragraph into the relevant 
agreements and shall request the financial intermediaries to report on their observance. 
3. 
When implementing financial instruments and budgetary guarantees in accordance with Title X, persons and entities 
shall apply the principles and standards set out in Union law on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the 
purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing, in particular Regulation (EU) 2015/847 of the European Parliament

been used by the person or entity in accordance with the conditions laid down in the relevant grant, contribution or 
financing agreement. 
6. 
Contribution agreements, financing agreements and guarantee agreements shall clearly define the responsibilities and 
obligations of the person or entity implementing Union funds, including the obligations set out in Article 129 and the 
conditions for payment of the contribution. Such agreements shall also, where applicable, define the mutually agreed 
remuneration which shall be commensurate with the conditions under which the actions are implemented, taking due 
account of situations of crisis and fragility, and, where appropriate, be performance-based. Those agreements shall also 
include rules on reporting to the Commission on how the tasks are performed, the results expected, including indicators 
on measuring performance, and the obligation for persons or entities implementing Union funds to notify the 
Commission without delay of cases of detected fraud and irregularities and their follow-up.

All contracts shall be put out to competition on the broadest possible basis, except when use is made of the 
procedure referred to in point (d) of Article 164(1). 
The estimated value of a contract shall not be determined with a view to circumventing the applicable rules, nor shall a 
contract be split up for that purpose. 
The contracting authority shall divide a contract into lots, whenever appropriate, with due regard to broad competition. 
3. 
Contracting authorities shall not use framework contracts improperly or in such a way that their purpose or effect 
is to prevent, restrict or distort competition.

appropriations in respect of its participation in procurement procedures financed in whole or in part from the budget. 
5. 
The rules on procurement laid down in this Regulation shall not apply to the activities of the JRC on behalf of third 
parties, with the exception of the principles of transparency and equal treatment. 
Article 161 
Annex on procurement and delegation of powers 
Detailed rules on procurement are laid down in Annex I to this Regulation. To ensure that Union institutions, when 
awarding contracts on their own account, apply the same standards as those imposed on contracting authorities covered 
by Directives 2014/23/EU and 2014/24/EU, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with 
Article 269 of this Regulation to amend Annex I to this Regulation, in order to align that Annex to amendments to those 
Directives and to introduce related technical adjustments. 
Article 162 
Mixed contracts and common procurement vocabulary 
1. 
A mixed contract covering two or more types of procurement (works, supplies or services) or concessions (works or 
services) or both, shall be awarded in accordance with the provisions applicable to the type of procurement that 
characterises the main subject matter of the contract in question. 
2. 
In the case of mixed contracts consisting of supplies and services, the main subject matter shall be determined by a 
comparison of the values of the respective supplies or services. 
A contract covering one type of procurement (works, supplies or services) and concessions (works or services) shall be 
awarded in accordance with the provisions applicable to the public contract concerned. 
3. 
This Title shall not apply to contracts for technical assistance concluded with the EIB or the EIF. 
4. 
Any references to nomenclatures in the context of procurement shall be made using the Common Procurement 
Vocabulary (CPV) as set out in Regulation (EC) No 2195/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ). 
Article 163

Vocabulary (CPV) (OJ L 340, 16.12.2002, p. 1).
 
(b) a contract award notice on the results of the procedure. 
2. 
Procedures with a value below the thresholds referred to in Article 175(1) or Article 178 shall be advertised by 
appropriate means. 
3. 
Publication of certain information on a contract award may be withheld where its release would impede law 
enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, would harm the legitimate commercial interests of 
economic operators or might prejudice fair competition between them. 
Article 164 
Procurement procedures 
1. 
Procurement procedures for awarding concession contracts or public contracts, including framework contracts shall 
take one of the following forms: 
(a) open procedure; 
(b) restricted procedure, including through a dynamic purchasing system; 
(c) design contest; 
(d) negotiated procedure, including without prior publication; 
(e) competitive dialogue; 
(f) competitive procedure with negotiation; 
(g) innovation partnership; 
(h) procedures involving a call for expression of interest. 
2. 
In open procedures any interested economic operator may submit a tender. 
3. 
In restricted procedures, competitive dialogues, competitive procedures with negotiation and innovation partner­
ships, any economic operator may submit a request to participate by providing the information that is requested by the 
contracting authority. The contracting authority shall invite all candidates, that satisfy the selection criteria and that are 
not in any of the situations referred to in Articles 136(1) and 141(1), to submit a tender. 
Notwithstanding the first subparagraph, the contracting authority may limit the number of candidates to be invited to 
participate in the procedure on the basis of objective and non-discriminatory selection criteria, which shall be indicated in 
the contract notice or the call for expression of interest. The number of candidates invited shall be sufficient to ensure 
genuine competition. 
4. 
In all procedures involving negotiation, the contracting authority shall negotiate with tenderers the initial and any 
subsequent tenders or parts thereof, except their final tenders, in order to improve their content. The minimum 
requirements and the criteria specified in the procurement documents shall not be subject to negotiation. 
A contracting authority may award a contract on the basis of the initial tender without negotiation where it has indicated 
in the procurement documents that it reserves the possibility to do so. 
5. 
The contracting authority may use: 
(a) the open or restricted procedure for any purchase; 
(b) the procedures involving a call for expression of interest for contracts with a value below the thresholds referred to in 
Article 175(1), to preselect candidates to be invited to submit tenders in response to future restricted invitations to 
tender, or to collect a list of vendors to be invited to submit requests to participate or submit tenders; 
(c) the design contest to acquire a plan or design selected by a jury after being put out to competition; 
(d) the innovation partnership to develop an innovative product, service or innovative works and for the subsequent 
purchase of the resulting supply, services or works; 
(e) the competitive procedure with negotiation or the competitive dialogue for concession contracts, for the service 
contracts referred to in Annex XIV to Directive 2014/24/EU, in cases where only irregular or unacceptable tenders 
were submitted in response to an open or restricted procedure after the initial procedure has been completed, and for 
cases where this is justified by the specific circumstances linked, inter alia, to the nature or the complexity of the 
subject matter of the contract or to the specific type of contract, as further detailed in Annex I to this Regulation;
EN 
L 193/112 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
(f) the negotiated procedure for contracts with a value below the thresholds referred to in Article 175(1), or the 
negotiated procedure without prior publication for specific types of purchases falling outside the scope of 
Directive 2014/24/EU or in the clearly defined exceptional circumstances set out in Annex I to this Regulation. 
6. 
A dynamic purchasing system shall be open throughout its duration to any economic operator who satisfies the 
selection criteria. 
The contracting authority shall follow the rules of the restricted procedure for procurement through a dynamic 
purchasing system. 
Article 165 
Interinstitutional procurement and joint procurement 
1. 
Where a contract or a framework contract is of interest to two or more Union institutions, executive agencies or 
Union bodies referred to in Articles 70 and 71, and whenever there is a possibility for realising efficiency gains, the 
contracting authorities concerned may carry out the procedure and the management of the subsequent contract or 
framework contract on an interinstitutional basis under the lead of one of the contracting authorities. 
The bodies and persons entrusted with the implementation of specific actions in the CFSP pursuant to Title V of the TEU 
as well as the Office of the Secretary of the Board of Governors of the European Schools may also participate in 
interinstitutional procedures. 
The terms of a framework contract shall only apply between those contracting authorities that are identified for that 
purpose in the procurement documents and those economic operators that are party to the framework contract. 
2. 
Where a contract or framework contract is necessary for the implementation of a joint action between a Union 
institution and one or more contracting authorities from Member States, the procurement procedure may be carried out 
jointly by the Union institution and the contracting authorities. 
Joint procurement may be conducted with EFTA States and Union candidate countries if that possibility has been 
specifically provided for in a bilateral or multilateral treaty. 
The procedural provisions applicable to Union institutions shall apply to the joint procurement. 
Where the share pertaining to or managed by the contracting authority of a Member State in the total estimated value of 
the contract is equal to or above 50 %, or in other duly justified cases, the Union institution may decide that the 
procedural rules applicable to the contracting authority of a Member State shall apply to the joint procurement, provided 
that those rules may be considered as equivalent to those of the Union institution. 
The Union institution and the contracting authority from a Member State, an EFTA State or a Union candidate country 
concerned by the joint procurement shall agree in particular upon the detailed practical arrangements for the evaluation 
of the requests for participation or of the tenders, the award of the contract, the law applicable to the contract and the 
competent court for hearing disputes. 
Article 166 
Preparation of a procurement procedure 
1. 
Before launching a procurement procedure, the contracting authority may conduct a preliminary market consul­
tation with a view to preparing the procedure. 
2. 
In the procurement documents, the contracting authority shall identify the subject matter of the procurement by 
providing a description of its needs and the characteristics required of the works, supplies or services to be bought, and 
shall specify the applicable exclusion, selection and award criteria. The contracting authority shall also indicate which 
elements define the minimum requirements to be met by all tenders. Minimum requirements shall include compliance 
with applicable environmental, social and labour law obligations established by Union law, national law, collective 
agreements or the applicable international social and environmental conventions listed in Annex X to Directive 
2014/24/EU. 
Article 167

Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/113
 
(b) the candidate or tenderer is not excluded under Article 136 or rejected under Article 141; 
(c) the candidate or tenderer meets the selection criteria specified in the procurement documents and is not subject to 
conflicts of interest which may negatively affect the performance of the contract. 
2. 
The contracting authority shall apply the selection criteria to evaluate the capacity of the candidate or tenderer. 
Selection criteria shall only relate to the legal and regulatory capacity to pursue the professional activity, the economic 
and financial capacity, and the technical and professional capacity. The JRC shall be presumed to meet the requirements 
relating to financial capacity. 
3. 
The contracting authority shall apply the award criteria to evaluate the tender. 
4. 
The contracting authority shall base the award of contracts on the most economically advantageous tender, which 
shall consist in one of three award methods: lowest price, lowest cost or best price-quality ratio. 
For the lowest cost method, the contracting authority shall use a cost-effectiveness approach including life-cycle costing. 
For the best price-quality ratio, the contracting authority shall take into account the price or cost and other quality criteria 
linked to the subject matter of the contract. 
Article 168 
Submission, electronic communication and evaluation 
1. 
The contracting authority shall lay down time limits for the receipt of tenders and requests to participate in 
accordance with point 24 of Annex I and taking into account the complexity of the purchase, leaving an adequate 
period for economic operators to prepare their tenders. 
2. 
If deemed appropriate and proportionate, the contracting authority may require tenderers to lodge a guarantee to 
make sure that the tenders submitted are not withdrawn before contract signature. The required guarantee shall represent 
1 to 2 % of the total estimated value of the contract. 
The contracting authority shall release the guarantees: 
(a) in respect of tenderers or tenders rejected as referred to in point 30.2(b) or (c) of Annex I, after having provided the 
information on the outcome of the procedure; 
(b) in respect of tenderers ranked as referred to in point 30.2(e) of Annex I, after the contract is signed. 
3. 
The contracting authority shall open all requests to participate and tenders. However, it shall reject: 
(a) requests to participate and tenders which do not comply with the time limit for receipt, without opening them; 
(b) tenders already open when they are received, without examining their content. 
4. 
The contracting authority shall evaluate all requests to participate or tenders not rejected during the opening phase 
as laid down in paragraph 3 on the basis of the criteria specified in the procurement documents with a view to awarding 
the contract or to proceeding with an electronic auction. 
5. 
The authorising officer may waive the appointment of an evaluation committee as provided for in Article 150(2) in 
the following cases: 
(a) the value of the contract is below the thresholds referred to in Article 175(1); 
(b) on the basis of a risk analysis for the cases referred to in points (c), (e), (f)(i), (f)(iii) and (h) of the second subparagraph 
of point 11.1 of Annex I; 
(c) on the basis of a risk analysis when reopening competition within a framework contract; 
(d) for procedures in the field of external actions having a value of less than or equal to EUR 20 000. 
6. 
Requests to participate and tenders which do not comply with all the minimum requirements set out in the 
procurement documents shall be rejected. 
Article 169 
Contacts during the procurement procedure 
1. 
Before the time limit for receipt of requests to participate or tenders, the contracting authority may communicate 
additional information about the procurement documents if it discovers an error or omission in the text or upon request 
from candidates or tenderers. Information provided shall be disclosed to all candidates or tenderers.
EN 
L 193/114 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
2. 
After the time limit for receipt of requests to participate or tenders, in every case where contact has been made, and 
in the duly justified cases where contact has not been made as provided for in Article 151, a record shall be kept in the 
procurement file. 
Article 170 
Award decision and information to candidates or tenderers 
1. 
The authorising officer responsible shall decide to whom the contract is to be awarded, in compliance with the 
selection and award criteria specified in the procurement documents. 
2. 
The contracting authority shall notify all candidates or tenderers, whose requests to participate or tenders are 
rejected, of the grounds on which the decision was taken, as well as the duration of the standstill periods referred to 
in Articles 175(2) and 178(1). 
For the award of specific contracts under a framework contract with reopening of competition, the contracting authority 
shall inform the tenderers of the result of the evaluation. 
3. 
The contracting authority shall inform each tenderer who is not in an exclusion situation referred to in 
Article 136(1), who is not rejected under Article 141, whose tender is compliant with the procurement documents 
and who makes a request in writing, of any of the following: 
(a) the name of the tenderer, or tenderers in the case of a framework contract, to whom the contract is awarded and, 
except in the case of a specific contract under a framework contract with reopening of competition, the characteristics 
and relative advantages of the successful tender, the price paid or contract value, whichever is appropriate; 
(b) the progress of negotiation and dialogue with tenderers. 
However, the contracting authority may decide to withhold certain information where its release would impede law 
enforcement, would be contrary to the public interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of economic 
operators or might distort fair competition between them. 
Article 171 
Cancellation of the procurement procedure 
The contracting authority may, before the contract is signed, cancel the procurement procedure without the candidates or 
tenderers being entitled to claim any compensation. 
The decision shall be justified and brought to the attention of the candidates or tenderers as soon as possible. 
Article 172 
Performance and modifications of the contract 
1. 
Performance of the contract shall not start before it is signed. 
2. 
The contracting authority may modify a contract or framework contract without a procurement procedure only in 
the cases provided for in paragraph 3 and provided the modification does not alter the subject matter of the contract or 
framework contract. 
3. 
A contract, a framework contract or a specific contract under a framework contract may be modified without a new 
procurement procedure in any of the following cases: 
(a) for additional works, supplies or services by the original contractor that have become necessary and that were not 
included in the initial procurement, where the following conditions are fulfilled: 
(i) a change of contractor cannot be made for technical reasons linked to interchangeability or interoperability 
requirements with existing equipment, services or installations; 
(ii) a change of contractor would cause substantial duplication of costs for the contracting authority; 
(iii) any increase in price, including the net cumulative value of successive modifications, does not exceed 50 % of the 
initial contract value;

(i) the need for modification has been brought about by circumstances which a diligent contracting authority could 
not foresee;

(d) where both of the following conditions are fulfilled: 
(i) the minimum requirements of the initial procurement procedure are not altered; 
(ii) any ensuing modification of value complies with the conditions set out in point (c) of this subparagraph, unless

The net cumulative value of several successive modifications under point (c) of the first subparagraph shall not exceed any 
threshold referred to therein.

time limits set out in Article 116(1) and to be specified in the contract. It may be released partially or fully upon 
provisional acceptance of the works, supplies or complex services. 
2. 
A retention money guarantee amounting to a maximum of 10 % of the total value of the contract may be 
constituted by deductions from interim payments as and when they are made or by deduction from the final payment. 
The contracting authority shall determine the amount of the retention money guarantee which shall be proportionate to 
the risks identified in relation to the performance of the contract, taking into account its subject matter and the usual 
commercial terms applicable in the sector concerned. 
A retention money guarantee shall not be used in a contract where a performance guarantee has been requested and not 
released. 
3. 
Subject to approval by the contracting authority, the contractor may request to replace the retention money 
guarantee by another type of guarantee referred to in Article 152. 
4.

TITLE VIII 
GRANTS 
CHAPTER 1 
Scope and form of grants 
Article 180 
Scope and form of grants 
1. 
This Title applies to grants awarded under direct management. 
2. 
Grants may be awarded in order to finance any of the following: 
(a) an action intended to help achieve a Union policy objective (‘action grants’); 
(b) the functioning of a body which has an objective forming part of, and supporting, a Union policy (‘operating grants’). 
Operating grants shall take the form of a financial contribution to the work programme of the body referred to in 
point (b) of the first subparagraph. 
3. 
Grants may take any of the forms provided for in Article 125(1). 
Where the grant takes the form of financing not linked to costs pursuant to point (a) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 125(1): 
(a) the provisions related to eligibility and verification of costs laid down in this Title, in particular Articles 182, 184 and 
185, Article 186(2), (3) and (4), Article 190, Articles 191(3) and 203(4), shall not apply; 
(b) as regards Article 181, only the procedure and the requirements referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of that Article, 
points (a) and (d) of the first subparagraph and the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, and paragraph 5, of that 
Article shall apply. 
4. 
Each Union institution may award public contracts or grants for communication activities. Grants may be awarded 
where the use of procurement is not appropriate due to the nature of activities. 
5. 
The JRC may receive funding charged to appropriations other than research and technological development 
appropriations in respect of its participation in grant award procedures financed in whole or in part from the budget. 
In such cases, Article 198(4), as far as financial capacity is concerned, and points (a) to (d) of Article 196(1) shall not 
apply. 
Article 181 
Lump sums, unit costs and flat-rate financing 
1. 
Where the grant takes the form of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing as referred to in point (c), (d) or (e) 
of the first subparagraph of Article 125(1), this Title shall apply, with the exception of the provisions or parts of the 
provisions related to the verification of eligible costs actually incurred.
EN 
L 193/118 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
2. 
Where possible and appropriate, lump sums, unit costs or flat rates shall be determined in such a way as to allow 
their payment upon achievement of concrete outputs and/or results. 
3. 
Unless otherwise provided in the basic act, the use of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing shall be authorised 
by a decision of the authorising officer responsible, who shall act in accordance with the internal rules of the Union 
institution concerned. 
4. 
The authorisation decision shall contain at least the following: 
(a) justification concerning the appropriateness of such forms of financing with regard to the nature of the supported 
actions or work programmes, as well as to the risks of irregularities and fraud and costs of control; 
(b) identification of the costs or categories of costs covered by lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing, which shall be 
considered eligible in accordance with points (c), (e) and (f) of Article 186(3) and Article 186(4), and which shall 
exclude ineligible costs under the applicable Union rules; 
(c) description of the methods for determining lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing. Those methods shall be based 
on one of the following: 
(i) statistical data, similar objective means or an expert judgement provided by internally available experts or 
procured in accordance with the applicable rules; or 
(ii) beneficiary-by-beneficiary approach, by reference to certified or auditable historical data of the beneficiary or to its 
usual cost accounting practices; 
(d) where possible, the essential conditions triggering the payment, including, where applicable, the achievement of 
outputs and/or results; 
(e) where lump sums, unit costs and flat rates are not output based and/or result based, a justification on why an output 
based and/or result based approach is not possible or appropriate. 
The methods referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph shall ensure: 
(a) the respect for the principle of sound financial management, in particular the appropriateness of the respective 
amounts with regard to the required outputs and/or results taking into account foreseeable revenue to be 
generated by the actions or work programmes; 
(b) reasonable compliance with the principles of co-financing and no double funding. 
5. 
The authorisation decision shall apply for the duration of the programme or programmes unless otherwise provided 
in that decision. 
The authorisation decision may cover the use of lump sums, unit costs or flat rates applicable to more than one specific 
funding programme where the nature of the activities or of the expenditure allow for a common approach. In such cases, 
the authorising decision may be adopted by the following: 
(a) the authorising officers responsible where all activities concerned fall under their responsibility; 
(b) the Commission where this is appropriate in view of the nature of the activities or of the expenditure or in view of 
the number of authorising officers concerned. 
6. 
The authorising officer responsible may authorise or impose, in the form of flat-rates, funding of the beneficiary’s 
indirect costs up to a maximum of 7 % of total eligible direct costs for the action. A higher flat rate may be authorised by 
a reasoned Commission decision. The authorising officer responsible shall report in the annual activity report referred to 
in Article 74(9) on any such decision taken, the flat rate authorised and the reasons leading to that decision. 
7. 
SME owners and other natural persons who do not receive a salary may declare eligible personnel costs for the 
work carried out by themselves under an action or work programme, on the basis of unit costs authorised in accordance 
with paragraphs 1 to 6. 
8. 
Beneficiaries may declare personnel costs for the work carried out by volunteers under an action or work 
programme, on the basis of unit costs authorised in accordance with paragraphs 1 to 6. 
Article 182 
Single lump sums 
1. 
A lump sum as referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(1) may cover the entire eligible costs 
of an action or a work programme (‘single lump sum’).
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/119
 
2. 
In accordance with Article 181(4), single lump sums may be determined on the basis of the estimated budget of the 
action or work programme. Such estimated budget shall comply with the principles of economy, efficiency and effec­
tiveness. The compliance with those principles shall be verified ex ante at the time of evaluation of the grant application. 
3. 
When authorising single lump sums the authorising officer responsible shall comply with Article 181. 
Article 183 
Checks and controls on beneficiaries related to lump sums, unit costs and flat rates 
1. 
The authorising officer responsible shall check, at the latest before the payment of the balance, the fulfilment of the 
conditions triggering the payment of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rates, including, where required, the achievement of 
outputs and/or results. In addition, the fulfilment of those conditions may be subject to ex post controls. 
The amounts of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing determined ex ante by application of the method authorised 
by the authorising officer responsible or the Commission in accordance with Article 181 shall not be challenged by ex 
post controls. This is without prejudice to the right of the authorising officer responsible to check that the conditions 
triggering the payment as referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph are fulfilled, and to reduce the grant in 
accordance with Article 131(4) where those conditions are not fulfilled or in the event of irregularity, fraud or a breach of 
other obligations. Where lump sums, unit costs or flat rates are established on the basis of the usual cost accounting 
practices of the beneficiary Article 185(2) shall apply. 
2. 
The frequency and scope of checks and controls may depend, inter alia, upon the nature of the action or the 
beneficiary, including past irregularities or fraud attributable to that beneficiary. 
3. 
The conditions triggering the payment of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rates shall not require reporting on the costs 
actually incurred by the beneficiary. 
4. 
Payment of the grant on the basis of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing shall not affect the right of access 
to the statutory records of the beneficiaries for the purposes referred to in Articles 129 and 184. 
5. 
For the purposes of the checks and controls referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, points (a) and (b) of 
Article 186(3) shall apply. 
Article 184 
Periodic assessment of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rates 
The method for determining lump sums, unit costs or flat rates, the underlying data and the resulting amounts, as well as 
the adequateness of those amounts with regard to the output and/or results delivered, shall be assessed periodically and, 
where appropriate, adjusted in accordance with Article 181. The frequency and scope of assessments shall depend on the 
evolution and the nature of the costs, in particular taking into account substantial changes in market prices and other 
relevant circumstances. 
Article 185 
Usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary 
1. 
Where recourse to the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary is authorised, the authorising officer 
responsible may assess compliance of those practices with the conditions set out in Article 181(4). That assessment 
may be carried out ex ante or by using an appropriate strategy for ex post controls. 
2. 
If the compliance of the beneficiary’s usual cost accounting practices with the conditions set out in Article 181(4) 
has been established ex ante, the amounts of lump sums, unit costs or flat-rate financing determined by application of 
those practices shall not be challenged by ex post controls. This shall not affect the right of the authorising officer 
responsible to reduce the grant in accordance with Article 131(4). 
3. 
The authorising officer responsible may consider that the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary comply 
with the conditions set out in Article 181(4) if they are accepted by national authorities under comparable funding 
schemes.

Article 186 
Eligible costs 
1. 
Grants shall not exceed an overall ceiling expressed in terms of an absolute value (‘maximum grant amount’) which 
shall be established on the basis of: 
(a) the overall amount of financing not linked to costs in the case referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 125(1); 
(b) estimated eligible costs, where possible, in the case referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(1); 
(c) the overall amount of the estimated eligible costs clearly defined in advance in the form of lump sums, unit costs or 
flat rates as referred to in points (c), (d) and (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(1). 
Without prejudice to the basic act, grants may in addition be expressed as a percentage of the estimated eligible costs, 
where the grant takes the form specified in point (b) of the first subparagraph, or as a percentage of the lump sums, unit 
costs or flat rate financing referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph. 
Where the grant takes the form specified in point (b) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph and where, due to 
specificities of an action, the grant can only be expressed in terms of an absolute value, the verification of the eligible 
costs shall be done in accordance with Article 155(4) and, where applicable, Article 155(5). 
2. 
Without prejudice to the maximum co-financing rate specified in the basic act: 
(a) the grant shall not exceed the eligible costs; 
(b) where the grant takes the form specified in point (b) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and where the 
estimated eligible costs include costs for volunteers’ work referred to in Article 181(8), the grant shall not exceed 
the estimated eligible costs other than the costs for volunteers’ work. 
3. 
Eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary, as referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 125(1), shall meet all of the following criteria: 
(a) they are incurred during the duration of the action or of the work programme, with the exception of costs relating to 
final reports and audit certificates; 
(b) they are indicated in the estimated overall budget of the action or work programme; 
(c) they are necessary for the implementation of the action or of the work programme which is the subject of the grant; 
(d) they are identifiable and verifiable, in particular being recorded in the accounting records of the beneficiary and 
determined according to the applicable accounting standards of the country where the beneficiary is established and 
according to the usual cost accounting practices of the beneficiary; 
(e) they comply with the requirements of applicable tax and social legislation; 
(f) they are reasonable, justified, and comply with the principle of sound financial management, in particular regarding 
economy and efficiency. 
4. 
Calls for proposals shall specify the categories of costs considered as eligible for Union funding. 
Unless provided otherwise in the basic act and in addition to paragraph 3 of this Article, the following categories of costs 
shall be eligible where the authorising officer responsible has declared them as such under the call for proposals: 
(a) costs relating to a pre-financing guarantee lodged by the beneficiary, where that guarantee is required by the 
authorising officer responsible pursuant to Article 152(1); 
(b) costs relating to certificates on the financial statements and operational verification reports, where such certificates or 
reports are required by the authorising officer responsible;

(c) VAT, where it is not recoverable under the applicable national VAT legislation and is paid by a beneficiary other than 
a non-taxable person within the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of Council Directive 
2006/112/EC ( 1 ); 
(d) depreciation costs, provided they are actually incurred by the beneficiary; 
(e) salary costs of the personnel of national administrations to the extent that they relate to the cost of activities which 
the relevant public authority would not carry out if the project concerned were not undertaken. 
For the purposes of point (c) of the second subparagraph: 
(a) VAT shall be considered as not recoverable if according to national law it is attributable to any of the following 
activities: 
(i) exempt activities without right of deduction; 
(ii) activities which fall outside the scope of VAT; 
(iii) activities, as referred to in point (i) or (ii), in respect of which VAT is not deductible but refunded by means of 
specific refund schemes or compensation funds not referred to in Directive 2006/112/EC, even if that scheme or 
fund is established by national VAT legislation; 
(b) VAT relating to the activities listed in Article 13(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC shall be regarded as paid by a 
beneficiary other than a non-taxable person within the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 13(1) of that 
Directive, regardless of whether those activities are regarded by the Member State concerned as activities engaged in 
by bodies governed by public law acting as public authorities. 
Article 187 
Affiliated entities and sole beneficiary 
1. 
For the purpose of this Title, the following entities shall be considered as entities affiliated to the beneficiary: 
(a) entities forming the sole beneficiary in accordance with paragraph 2; 
(b) entities that satisfy the eligibility criteria and that do not fall within one of the situations referred to in Articles 136(1) 
and 141(1) and that have a link with the beneficiary, in particular a legal or capital link, which is neither limited to 
the action nor established for the sole purpose of its implementation. 
Section 2 of Chapter 2 of Title V shall apply also to affiliated entities. 
2. 
Where several entities satisfy the criteria for being awarded a grant and together form one entity, that entity may be 
treated as the sole beneficiary, including where the entity is specifically established for the purpose of implementing the 
action to be financed by the grant. 
3. 
Unless otherwise provided in the call for proposals, entities affiliated to a beneficiary may participate in the 
implementation of the action, provided that both of the following conditions are fulfilled: 
(a) the entities concerned are identified in the grant agreement; 
(b) the entities concerned abide by the rules applicable to the beneficiary under the grant agreement with regard to: 
(i) eligibility of costs or conditions triggering the payment; 
(ii) rights of checks and audits by the Commission, OLAF and the Court of Auditors. 
Costs incurred by such entities may be accepted as eligible costs actually incurred or may be covered by lump sums, unit 
costs and flat-rate financing.

Grants shall be awarded following a publication of calls for proposals, except in the cases referred to in Article 195. 
2. 
All grants awarded in the course of a financial year shall be published in accordance with Article 38(1) to (4). 
3. 
Following the publication referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, when requested by the European Parliament and by the 
Council, the Commission shall forward a report to them on: 
(a) the number of applicants in the preceding financial year; 
(b) the number and percentage of successful applications per call for proposals; 
(c) the average duration of the procedure from the date of closure of the call for proposals to the award of a grant;

(e) any grant awarded to financial institutions, including the EIB or the EIF in accordance with point (g) of the first 
paragraph of Article 195. 
Article 190 
Co-financing 
1. 
Grants shall involve co-financing. As a result, the resources necessary to carry out the action or the work 
programme shall not be provided entirely by the grant. 
Co-financing may be provided in the form of the beneficiary’s own resources, income generated by the action or work 
programme or financial or in-kind contributions from third parties. 
2. 
In-kind contributions from third parties in the form of volunteers’ work valued in accordance with Article 181(8) 
shall be presented as eligible costs in the estimated budget. They shall be presented separately from other eligible costs. 
Volunteers’ work may comprise up to 50 % of the co-financing. For the purposes of calculating that percentage, in-kind 
contributions and other co-financing shall be based on the estimates provided by the applicant. 
Other in-kind contributions from third parties shall be presented separately from the contributions to the eligible costs in 
the estimated budget. Their approximate value shall be indicated in the estimated budget and shall not be subject to 
subsequent changes. 
3. 
By way of derogation from paragraph 1, an external action may be financed in full by the grant where this is 
essential for it to be carried out. In such a case, justification shall be provided in the award decision. 
4. 
This Article shall not apply to interest rate rebates and guarantee fee subsidies. 
Article 191 
Principle of non-cumulative award and prohibition of double funding 
1. 
Each action may give rise to the award of only one grant from the budget to any one beneficiary, except where 
otherwise authorised in the relevant basic acts. 
A beneficiary may be awarded only one operating grant from the budget per financial year. 
An action may be financed jointly from separate budget lines by different authorising officers responsible.

2. 
The applicant shall immediately inform the authorising officers of any multiple applications and multiple grants 
relating to the same action or to the same work programme. 
3. 
In no circumstances shall the same costs be financed twice by the budget. 
4. 
In relation to the following types of support, paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply and, where appropriate, the 
Commission may decide not to verify whether the same cost was financed twice: 
(a) study, research, training or education support paid to natural persons; 
(b) direct support paid to natural persons most in need, such as unemployed persons and refugees. 
Article 192 
No-profit principle 
1. 
Grants shall not have the purpose or effect of producing a profit within the framework of the action or the work 
programme of the beneficiary (‘no-profit principle’). 
2. 
For the purposes of paragraph 1, a profit shall be defined as a surplus, calculated at the payment of the balance, of 
receipts over the eligible costs of the action or work programme, where receipts are limited to the Union grant and the 
revenue generated by that action or work programme. 
In the case of an operating grant, amounts dedicated to the building up of reserves shall not be taken into account for 
verifying compliance with the no-profit principle. 
3. 
Paragraph 1 shall not apply to: 
(a) actions the objective of which is the reinforcement of the financial capacity of a beneficiary, or actions which generate 
income to ensure their continuity after the period of Union financing provided for in the grant agreement; 
(b) study, research, training or education support paid to natural persons or other direct support paid to natural persons 
most in need, such as unemployed persons and refugees; 
(c) actions implemented by non-profit organisations; 
(d) grants in the form referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 125(1); 
(e) low value grants. 
4. 
Where a profit is made, the Commission shall be entitled to recover the percentage of the profit corresponding to 
the Union contribution to the eligible costs actually incurred by the beneficiary in carrying out the action or work 
programme. 
Article 193 
Principle of non-retroactivity 
1. 
Unless otherwise provided in this Article grants shall not be awarded retroactively. 
2. 
A grant may be awarded for an action which has already begun provided that the applicant can demonstrate the 
need for starting the action prior to signature of the grant agreement. 
In such cases, costs incurred prior to the date of submission of the grant application shall not be eligible, except: 
(a) in duly justified exceptional cases as provided for in the basic act; or 
(b) in the event of extreme urgency for measures referred to in point (a) or (b) of the first paragraph of Article 195 
whereby an early intervention by the Union would be of major importance. 
In the case referred to in point (b) of the second subparagraph, the costs incurred by a beneficiary before the date of 
submission of the application shall be eligible for Union financing under the following conditions: 
(a) the reasons for such derogation have been properly substantiated by the authorising officer responsible; 
(b) the grant agreement explicitly sets the eligibility date earlier than the date for submission of applications. 
The authorising officer by delegation shall report on each of the cases referred to in this paragraph under the heading 
‘Derogations from the principle of non-retroactivity pursuant to Article 193 of the Financial Regulation’ in the annual

4. 
In the case of operating grants, the grant agreement shall be signed within four months of the start of the 
beneficiary’s financial year. Costs incurred before the grant application was submitted or before the start of the bene­
ficiary’s financial year shall not be eligible for financing. The first instalment shall be paid to the beneficiary within 30 
calendar days of the signature of the grant agreement. 
CHAPTER 3 
Grant award procedure and grant agreement 
Article 194 
Content and publication of calls for proposals 
1. 
Calls for proposals shall specify: 
(a) the objectives pursued; 
(b) the eligibility, exclusion, selection and award criteria and the relevant supporting documents; 
(c) the arrangements for Union financing, specifying all types of Union contributions, in particular the forms of grant; 
(d) the arrangements and final date for the submission of proposals; 
(e) the planned date by which all applicants are to be informed of the outcome of the evaluation of their application and 
the indicative date for the signature of grant agreements. 
2. 
The dates referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1 shall be fixed on the basis of the following periods: 
(a) for informing all applicants of the outcome of the evaluation of their application, a maximum of six months from the 
final date for submission of complete proposals; 
(b) for signing grant agreements with applicants, a maximum of three months from the date of informing applicants that 
they have been successful. 
Those periods may be adjusted in order to take into account any time needed to comply with specific procedures that 
may be required by the basic act in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 and may be exceeded in exceptional, 
duly justified cases, in particular for complex actions, where there is a large number of proposals or delays attributable to 
the applicants. 
The authorising officer by delegation shall report in his or her annual activity report on the average time taken to inform 
applicants and to sign grant agreements. In the event of the periods referred to in the first subparagraph being exceeded, 
the authorising officer by delegation shall give reasons and, where not duly justified in accordance with the second 
subparagraph, shall propose remedial action. 
3. 
Calls for proposals shall be published on the website of Union institutions and by any other appropriate means, 
including the Official Journal of the European Union, where it is necessary to provide additional publicity among potential 
beneficiaries. Calls for proposals may be published subject to the adoption of the financing decision referred to in 
Article 110, including during the year preceding budget implementation. Any modification of the content of the calls 
for proposals shall be published under the same conditions. 
Article 195 
Exceptions to calls for proposals 
Grants may be awarded without a call for proposals only in the following cases: 
(a) for the purposes of humanitarian aid, emergency support operations, civil protection operations or crisis management 
aid; 
(b) in other exceptional and duly substantiated emergencies; 
(c) to bodies with a de jure or de facto monopoly or to bodies designated by Member States, under their responsibility, 
where those Member States are in a de jure or de facto monopoly situation; 
(d) to bodies identified by a basic act, within the meaning of Article 58, as beneficiaries or to bodies designated by 
Member States, under their responsibility, where those Member States are identified by a basic act as beneficiaries;

30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/125
 
(e) in the case of research and technological development, to bodies identified in the work programme referred to in 
Article 110, where the basic act expressly provides for that possibility, and on condition that the project does not fall 
under the scope of a call for proposals; 
(f) for activities with specific characteristics that require a particular type of body on account of its technical competence, 
its high degree of specialisation or its administrative powers, on condition that the activities concerned do not fall 
within the scope of a call for proposals; 
(g) to the EIB or the EIF for actions of technical assistance. In such cases, points (a) to (d) of Article 196(1) shall not 
apply. 
Where the particular type of body referred to in point (f) of the first paragraph is a Member State, the grant may also be 
awarded without a call for proposals to the body designated by the Member State, under its responsibility, for the 
purpose of implementing the action. 
The cases referred to in points (c) and (f) of the first paragraph shall be duly substantiated in the award decision.

action or work programme and, if decided by the authorising officer responsible on the basis of a risk assessment, 
supporting documents confirming that information, such as the profit and loss account and the balance sheet for up 
to the three last financial years for which the accounts were closed; 
Such information and supporting documents shall not be requested from applicants to which the verification of the 
financial or operational capacity does not apply in accordance with Article 198(5) or (6). In addition, supporting 
documents shall not be requested for low value grants;

grant which exceeds EUR 100 000, an audit report produced by an approved external auditor, where it is available, 
and always in cases where a statutory audit is required by Union or national law, certifying the accounts for up to the

point, covering the last two financial years available, must be produced before signature of the financial framework 
partnership agreement. 
The authorising officer responsible may, depending on a risk assessment, waive the obligation referred to in the first

Article 151. The authorising officer shall keep appropriate records of contacts with applicants during the procedure. 
4. 
Upon completion of its work, the members of the evaluation committee shall sign a record of all the proposals 
examined, containing an assessment of their quality and identifying those which may receive funding.

into question the grant award decision or be contrary to the principle of equal treatment of applicants. 
CHAPTER 4 
Implementation of grants 
Article 202 
Amount of the grant and extension of audit findings 
1. 
The amount of the grant shall not become final until after the authorising officer responsible has approved the final 
reports and, where applicable, the accounts, without prejudice to subsequent audits, checks and investigations by the 
Union institution concerned, OLAF or the Court of Auditors. Article 131(4) shall apply also after the amount of the grant 
has become final. 
2. 
Where controls or audits demonstrate systemic or recurrent irregularities, fraud or a breach of obligations 
attributable to the beneficiary and having a material impact on a number of grants awarded to that beneficiary under 
similar conditions, the authorising officer responsible may suspend the implementation of the grant agreement or 
payments under all the grants concerned or, where appropriate, terminate the grant agreements concerned with that 
beneficiary, having regard to the seriousness of the findings. 
The authorising officer responsible may, in addition, reduce the grants, reject ineligible costs and recover amounts unduly 
paid in respect of all the grants affected by the systemic or recurrent irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations referred 
to in the first subparagraph that may be subject to audits, checks and investigations in accordance with the grant 
agreements affected. 
3. 
The authorising officer responsible shall determine the amounts to be reduced or recovered, wherever possible and 
practicable, on the basis of costs unduly declared as eligible for each grant concerned, following acceptance of the revised 
reports and financial statements submitted by the beneficiary.
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/129
 
4. 
Where it is not possible or practicable to quantify precisely the amount of ineligible costs for each grant concerned, 
the amounts to be reduced or recovered may be determined by extrapolating the reduction or recovery rate applied to the 
grants for which the systemic or recurrent irregularities, fraud or breach of obligations have been demonstrated, or, where 
ineligible costs cannot serve as a basis for determining the amounts to be reduced or recovered, by applying a flat rate, 
having regard to the principle of proportionality. The beneficiary shall be given the opportunity to propose a duly 
substantiated alternative method or rate before the reduction or recovery is made. 
Article 203 
Supporting documents for payment requests 
1. 
The authorising officer responsible shall specify the supporting documents required to accompany payment 
requests. 
2. 
For each grant, pre-financing may be split into several instalments in accordance with sound financial management. 
The request for a further pre-financing instalment shall be accompanied by a beneficiary’s statement on the consumption 
of previous pre-financing. The instalment shall be paid in full if at least 70 % of the total amount of any earlier pre- 
financing has been consumed. Otherwise, the instalment shall be reduced by the amounts still to be consumed until that 
threshold is reached. 
3. 
The beneficiary shall, without prejudice to the obligation to provide supporting documents, certify on its honour 
that information contained in payment requests is full, reliable and true. The beneficiary shall also certify that the costs 
incurred are eligible in accordance with the grant agreement and that payment requests are substantiated by adequate 
supporting documents that may be checked. 
4. 
A certificate on the financial statements of the action or the work programme and underlying accounts may be 
demanded by the authorising officer responsible in support of interim payments or payments of balances of any amount. 
Such a certificate shall be requested on the basis of a risk assessment taking into account, in particular, the amount of the 
grant, the amount of the payment, the nature of the beneficiary and the nature of the supported activities. 
The certificate shall be produced by an approved external auditor or, in the case of public bodies, by a competent and 
independent public officer. 
The certificate shall certify, in accordance with a methodology approved by the authorising officer responsible and on the 
basis of agreed-upon procedures compliant with international standards, that the costs declared by the beneficiary in the 
financial statements on which the payment request is based are real, accurately recorded and eligible in accordance with 
the grant agreement. In specific and duly justified cases, the authorising officer responsible may request the certificate in 
the form of an opinion or other format in accordance with international standards. 
5. 
An operational verification report, produced by an independent third party approved by the authorising officer 
responsible, may be requested by the authorising officer responsible in support of any payment, on the basis of a risk 
assessment. The operational verification report shall state that the operational verification was done in accordance with a 
methodology approved by the authorising officer responsible and whether the action or work programme was actually 
implemented in accordance with the conditions set out in the grant agreement. 
Article 204 
Financial support to third parties 
Where implementation of an action or a work programme requires the provision of financial support to third parties, the 
beneficiary may provide such financial support if the conditions for such provision are defined in the grant agreement 
between the beneficiary and the Commission, with no margin for discretion by the beneficiary. 
No margin for discretion shall be considered to exist if the grant agreement specifies the following: 
(a) the maximum amount of financial support that can be paid to a third party which shall not exceed EUR 60 000 and 
the criteria for determining the exact amount; 
(b) the different types of activities that may receive such financial support, on the basis of a fixed list; 
(c) the definition of the persons or categories of persons which may receive such financial support and the criteria for 
providing it. 
The threshold referred to in point (a) of the second paragraph may be exceeded where achieving the objectives of the 
actions would otherwise be impossible or overly difficult.

Article 205 
Implementation contracts 
1. 
Without prejudice to Directive 2014/24/EU and Directive 2014/25/EU of the European Parliament and of the 
Council ( 1 ), where the implementation of the action or work programme requires the award of a public contract, the 
beneficiary may award the public contract in accordance with its usual purchasing practices provided that the public 
contract is awarded to the tender offering best value for money or, as appropriate, to the tender offering the lowest price, 
while avoiding any conflict of interests. 
2. 
Where implementation of the action or work programme requires the award of a public contract with a value of 
more than EUR 60 000, the authorising officer responsible may, if duly justified, require the beneficiary to abide by 
special rules in addition to those referred to in paragraph 1. 
Those special rules shall be based on rules contained in this Regulation and shall be proportionate to the value of the 
public contracts concerned, the relative size of the Union contribution in relation to the total cost of the action and the 
risk. Such special rules shall be included in the grant agreement.

TITLE X 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, BUDGETARY GUARANTEES AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 
CHAPTER 1 
Common provisions 
Article 208 
Scope and implementation 
1. 
Where it proves to be the most appropriate way to achieve policy objectives of the Union, the Union may establish 
financial instruments or provide budgetary guarantees or financial assistance backed by the budget by means of a basic 
act defining their scope and period of implementation. 
2. 
Member States may contribute to the Union’s financial instruments, budgetary guarantees or financial assistance. If 
authorised by the basic act, third parties may also contribute. 
3. 
Where financial instruments are implemented under shared management with Member States, sector-specific rules 
shall apply. 
4. 
Where financial instruments or budgetary guarantees are implemented under indirect management, the Commission 
shall conclude agreements with entities pursuant to points (c)(ii), (iii), (v) and (vi) of the first subparagraph of 
Article 62(1). Where the systems, rules and procedures of those entities have been assessed pursuant to Article 154(4), 
they may fully rely on those systems, rules and procedures. Those entities may, when implementing financial instruments 
and budgetary guarantees under indirect management, conclude agreements with financial intermediaries which shall be 
selected in accordance with procedures equivalent to those applied by the Commission. Those entities shall transpose the 
requirements pursuant to Article 155(2) in those agreements. 
The Commission shall remain responsible for ensuring that the implementation framework for financial instruments 
complies with the principle of sound financial management and supports the attainment of defined and time-bound 
policy objectives, measurable in terms of outputs and/or results. The Commission shall be accountable for the imple­
mentation of financial instruments without prejudice to the entrusted entities’ legal and contractual responsibility in 
accordance with the applicable law and Article 129.
EN 
L 193/132 
Official Journal of the European Union 
30.7.2018
 
Where third countries contribute to financial instruments or budgetary guarantees pursuant to paragraph 2, the basic act 
may allow for the designation of eligible implementing entities or counterparts from the countries concerned. 
5. 
The Court of Auditors shall have full access to any information related to the financial instruments, budgetary 
guarantees and financial assistance, including by means of on-the-spot checks. 
The Court of Auditors shall be the external auditor responsible for the projects and programmes supported by a financial 
instrument, a budgetary guarantee or a financial assistance. 
Article 209 
Principles and conditions applicable to financial instruments and budgetary guarantees 
1. 
Financial instruments and budgetary guarantees shall be used in accordance with the principles of sound financial 
management, transparency, proportionality, non-discrimination, equal treatment and subsidiarity, and in accordance with 
their objectives. 
2. 
Financial instruments and budgetary guarantees shall: 
(a) address market failures or sub-optimal investment situations and provide support, in a proportionate manner, only to 
final recipients that are deemed economically viable according to internationally accepted standards at the time of the 
Union financial support; 
(b) achieve additionality by preventing the replacement of potential support and investment from other public or private 
sources; 
(c) not distort competition in the internal market and be consistent with State aid rules; 
(d) achieve a leverage and a multiplier effect, with a target range of values based on an ex ante evaluation for the 
corresponding financial instrument or budgetary guarantee, by mobilising a global investment exceeding the size of 
the Union contribution or guarantee, including, where appropriate, the maximisation of private investment; 
(e) be implemented in a way to ensure that there is a common interest of the implementing entities or counterparts 
involved in the implementation in achieving the policy objectives defined in the relevant basic act, with provisions on 
for example co-investment, risk sharing requirements or financial incentives, while preventing a conflict of interests 
with other activities of the entities or counterparts; 
(f) provide for remuneration of the Union that is consistent with the sharing of risk among financial participants and the 
policy objectives of the financial instrument or budgetary guarantee; 
(g) where remuneration of the implementing entities or the counterparts involved in the implementation is due, provide 
that such remuneration is performance-based and comprises: 
(i) administrative fees to remunerate the entity or counterpart for the work carried out in the implementation of a 
financial instrument or budgetary guarantee, which shall, to the extent possible, be based on the operations 
carried out or the amounts disbursed; and 
(ii) where appropriate, policy related incentives to promote the achievement of the policy objectives or incentivise the 
financial performance of the financial instrument or budgetary guarantee. 
Exceptional expenses may be reimbursed in duly justified cases; 
(h) be based on ex ante evaluations, individually or as part of a programme, in line with Article 34, containing expla­
nations concerning the choice of the type of financial operation taking into account the policy objectives pursued and 
the associated financial risks and savings for the budget. 
The evaluations referred to in point (h) of the first subparagraph shall be reviewed and updated to take into account 
the effect of major socioeconomic changes on the rationale of the financial instrument or budgetary guarantee. 
3. 
Without prejudice to sector-specific rules for shared management, revenue, including dividends, capital gains, 
guarantee fees and interest on loans and on amounts on fiduciary accounts paid back to the Commission or on 
fiduciary accounts opened for financial instruments or budgetary guarantees and attributable to the support from the 
budget under a financial instrument or a budgetary guarantee, shall be entered in the budget after deduction of 
management costs and fees. 
Annual repayments, including capital repayments, guarantees released, and repayments of the principal of loans, paid 
back to the Commission or to fiduciary accounts opened for financial instruments or budgetary guarantees and 
attributable to the support from the budget under a financial instrument or a budgetary guarantee, shall constitute 
internal assigned revenue in accordance with point (f) of Article 21(3) and shall be used for the same financial instrument 
or budgetary guarantee, without prejudice to Article 215(5), for a period not exceeding the period for the budgetary 
commitment plus two years, unless otherwise specified in a basic act.
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/133
 
The Commission shall take into account such internal assigned revenue when proposing the amount for future allo­
cations for financial instruments or budgetary guarantees. 
Notwithstanding the second subparagraph, the outstanding amount of assigned revenue authorised under a basic act that 
is to be repealed or terminates may also be assigned to another financial instrument pursuing similar objectives, where 
this is provided in the basic act establishing that financial instrument. 
4. 
The authorising officer responsible for a financial instrument, a budgetary guarantee or a financial assistance shall 
produce a financial statement covering the period 1 January to 31 December, in accordance with Article 243 and in 
compliance with the accounting rules referred to in Article 80 and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards 
(IPSAS). 
For financial instruments and budgetary guarantees implemented under indirect management, the authorising officer 
responsible shall ensure that unaudited financial statements covering the period 1 January to 31 December prepared in 
compliance with the accounting rules referred to in Article 80 and with IPSAS, as well as any information necessary to 
produce financial statements in accordance with Article 82(2), be provided by the entities pursuant to points (c)(ii), (iii), 
(v) and (vi) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) by 15 February of the following financial year and that audited 
financial statements be provided by those entities by 15 May of the following financial year. 
Article 210 
Financial liability of the Union 
1. 
The financial liability and aggregate net payments from the budget shall not exceed at any time: 
(a) for financial instruments: the amount of the relevant budgetary commitment made for it; 
(b) for budgetary guarantees: the amount of the budgetary guarantee authorised by the basic act; 
(c) for financial assistance: the maximum amount of funds that the Commission is empowered to borrow for funding the 
financial assistance as authorised by the basic act, and the relevant interest. 
2. 
Budgetary guarantees and financial assistance may generate a contingent liability for the Union which shall only 
exceed the financial assets provided to cover the financial liability of the Union if provided for in a basic act establishing a 
budgetary guarantee or financial assistance and under the conditions set out therein. 
3. 
For the purposes of the annual assessment provided for in point (j) of Article 41(5), the contingent liabilities arising 
from budgetary guarantees or financial assistance borne by the budget shall be deemed sustainable, if their forecast 
multiannual evolution is compatible with the limits set by the regulation laying down the multiannual financial 
framework provided for in Article 312(2) TFEU and the ceiling on annual payment appropriations set out in Article 3(1) 
of Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom. 
Article 211 
Provisioning of financial liabilities 
1. 
For budgetary guarantees and financial assistance to third countries, a basic act shall set out a provisioning rate as a 
percentage of the amount of the financial liability authorised. That amount shall exclude the contributions referred to in 
Article 208(2). 
The basic act shall provide for the review of the provisioning rate at least every three years. 
2. 
The setting of a provisioning rate shall be guided by a qualitative and quantitative assessment by the Commission of 
the financial risks arising from a budgetary guarantee or a financial assistance to a third country in accordance with the 
principle of prudence, whereby assets and profits shall not be overestimated and liabilities and losses shall not be 
underestimated. 
Unless otherwise specified in the basic act establishing the budgetary guarantee or financial assistance to a third country, 
the provisioning rate shall be based on the global provisioning needed in advance to cover the net expected losses and, in 
addition, an adequate safety buffer. Without prejudice to the powers of the European Parliament and of the Council, the 
global provisioning shall be constituted over the period of time foreseen in the relevant financial statement as referred to 
in Article 35. 
3. 
For a financial instrument provision shall be made, where appropriate, to respond to future payments related to a 
budgetary commitment of that financial instrument.

4. 
The following resources shall contribute to the provisioning: 
(a) contributions from the budget, while fully respecting the regulation laying down the multiannual financial framework 
and after examination of the possibilities for redeployments; 
(b) returns on investments of the resources held in the common provisioning fund; 
(c) amounts recovered from defaulting debtors in accordance with the recovery procedure laid down in the guarantee or 
the loan agreement; 
(d) revenue and any other payments received by the Union in accordance with the guarantee or the loan agreement; 
(e) where applicable, contributions in cash by Member States and third parties pursuant to Article 208(2). 
Only the resources referred to in points (a) to (d) of the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be taken into account 
for calculating the provisioning resulting from the provisioning rate referred to in paragraph 1. 
5. 
Provisions shall be used for the payment of: 
(a) calls on the budgetary guarantee; 
(b) payment obligations related to a budgetary commitment for a financial instrument; 
(c) financial obligations arising from the borrowing of funds pursuant to Article 220(1); 
(d) where applicable, other expenses associated to the implementation of financial instruments, budgetary guarantees and 
financial assistance to third countries. 
6. 
Where the provisions for a budgetary guarantee exceed the amount of provisioning resulting from the provisioning 
rate referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, resources referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of the first subparagraph of 
paragraph 4 of this Article related to that guarantee shall be used within the limits of the eligible period provided for in 
the basic act, however, not beyond the constitution phase of the provisioning, and without prejudice to Article 213(4), to 
restore the budgetary guarantee up to its initial amount. 
7. 
The Commission shall immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council and may propose adequate 
replenishment measures or an increase of the provisioning rate where: 
(a) as a result of calls on a budgetary guarantee, the level of provisions for that budgetary guarantee falls below 50 % of 
the provisioning rate referred to in paragraph 1, and again where it falls below 30 % of that provisioning rate, or 
where it could fall below any of those percentages within a year according to a risk assessment by the Commission; 
(b) a country benefitting from financial assistance by the Union fails to pay on a maturity. 
Article 212 
Common provisioning fund 
1. 
The provisions made to cover the financial liabilities arising from financial instruments, budgetary guarantees or 
financial assistance shall be held in a common provisioning fund. 
By 30 June 2019, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council an independent external 
evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of entrusting the financial management of the assets of the common 
provisioning fund to the Commission, to the EIB, or to a combination of the two, taking into account the relevant 
technical and institutional criteria used in comparing asset management services, including the technical infrastructure, a 
comparison of costs for the services provided, the institutional set-up, reporting, performance, accountability and 
expertise of the Commission and the EIB and the other asset management mandates for the budget. The evaluation 
shall, where appropriate, be accompanied by a legislative proposal. 
2. 
Global profits or losses from the investment of the resources held in the common provisioning fund shall be 
allocated proportionately among the respective financial instruments, budgetary guarantees or financial assistance. 
The financial manager of the resources of the common provisioning fund shall keep a minimum amount of resources of 
the fund in cash or cash equivalents in accordance with prudential rules and the forecasts for payments provided by the 
authorising officers of the financial instruments, budgetary guarantees or financial assistance. 
The financial manager of the resources of the common provisioning fund may enter into repurchase agreements, with the 
resources of the common provisioning fund as collateral, to make payments out of the fund where this procedure is 
reasonably expected to be more beneficial for the budget than the divestment of resources within the timeframe of the 
payment request. The duration or roll-over period of repurchase agreements related to a payment shall be limited to the 
minimum necessary to minimise a loss for the budget.

3. 
Pursuant to point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 77(1) and Article 86(1) and (2), the accounting officer shall 
set up the procedures to be applied to the revenue and expenditure operations and, in agreement with the financial 
manager of the resources of the common provisioning fund, to the assets and liabilities related to the common 
provisioning fund. 
4. 
In the exceptional cases where the Commission has made a transfer as referred to in point (g) of the first 
subparagraph of Article 30(1), the Commission shall immediately inform the European Parliament and the Council 
thereof, and shall urgently propose the measures necessary to restore the budgetary item of the guarantee from which 
the transfer was made, while fully respecting the ceilings provided for in the regulation laying down the multiannual 
financial framework. 
Article 213 
Effective provisioning rate 
1. 
The provisioning of budgetary guarantees and financial assistance to third countries in the common provisioning 
fund shall be based on an effective provisioning rate. That rate shall provide a level of protection against the financial 
liabilities of the Union equivalent to the level that would be provided by the respective provisioning rates if the resources 
where held and managed separately. 
2. 
The effective provisioning rate applicable shall be a percentage of each initial provisioning rate determined in 
accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 211(2). It shall apply only to the amount of resources in the 
common provisioning fund foreseen for the payment of guarantee calls over a one year period. It shall provide for a 
ratio, in the form of a percentage, between the amount of cash and cash equivalents in the common provisioning fund 
required to honour guarantee calls and the total amount of cash and cash equivalents that would be required in each 
guarantee fund to honour guarantee calls, if the resources were held and managed separately, where both amounts 
represent an equivalent liquidity risk. That ratio shall not fall below 95 %. The calculation of the effective provisioning 
rate shall take into account: 
(a) the forecast of inflows and outflows in the common provisioning fund, having regard to the initial phase of 
constitution of global provisioning in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 211(2); 
(b) the risk correlation among the budgetary guarantees and the financial assistance to third countries; 
(c) the market conditions. 
The Commission shall by 1 July 2020 adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 269 to supplement this Regulation 
with detailed conditions for the calculation of the effective provisioning rate, including a methodology for that calcu­
lation. 
The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 269 to amend the minimum ratio 
referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph in the light of the experience gained with the operation of the 
common provisioning fund while maintaining a prudent approach in line with the principle of sound financial 
management. The minimum ratio shall not be set at a level lower than 85 %. 
3. 
The effective provisioning rate shall be calculated annually by the financial manager of the resources of the common 
provisioning fund and shall be the reference for the Commission’s calculation of the contributions from the budget 
pursuant to point (a) of Article 211(4) and, subsequently, point (b) of paragraph 4 of this Article. 
4. 
Following the calculation of the annual effective provisioning rate in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this 
Article, the following operations in the context of the budgetary procedure shall be made and presented in the working 
document referred to in point (h) of Article 41(5): 
(a) any surplus of provisions for a budgetary guarantee or a financial assistance to a third country shall be returned to the 
budget; 
(b) any replenishment of the fund shall be carried out in annual tranches during a maximum period of three years, 
without prejudice to Article 211(6). 
5. 
After having consulted the accounting officer, the Commission shall establish the guidelines applicable to the 
management of the resources in the common provisioning fund in accordance with appropriate prudential rules and 
excluding derivative operations for speculative purposes. Those guidelines shall be attached to the agreement with the 
financial manager of the resources of the common provisioning fund. 
An independent evaluation of the adequacy of the guidelines shall be carried out every three years and transmitted to the 
European Parliament and to the Council.

Notwithstanding Article 208(1), financial instruments may be established, in duly justified cases, without being 
authorised by means of a basic act, provided that such instruments are included in the draft budget in accordance with 
point (e) of the first subparagraph of Article 41(4). 
2. 
Where financial instruments or budgetary guarantees are combined within a single agreement with ancillary support

accordance with Article 250 and shall clearly identify which parts of the measure are financial instruments or budgetary 
guarantees. 
3. 
The Commission shall ensure a harmonised and simplified management of financial instruments, in particular in the 
area of accounting, reporting, monitoring and financial risk management. 
4. 
Where the Union participates in a financial instrument as a minority stakeholder, the Commission shall ensure 
compliance with this Title in accordance with the principle of proportionality, on the basis of the size and value of the 
participation of the Union in the instrument. However, irrespective of the size and value of the Union participation in the 
instrument, the Commission shall ensure compliance with Articles 129 and 155, Article 209(2) and (4), Article 250 and, 
insofar as the exclusion situations referred to in point (d) of Article 136(1) are concerned, Section 2 of Chapter 2 of 
Title V. 
5. 
Where the European Parliament or the Council consider that a financial instrument has not achieved its objectives 
effectively, they may request that the Commission submit a proposal for a revised basic act with a view to winding down 
the instrument. In the event of the winding down of the financial instrument, any new amount paid back to that 
instrument pursuant to Article 209(3) shall be considered as general revenue and returned to the budget. 
6. 
The purpose of the financial instruments or a grouping of financial instruments on a facility level and, where 
applicable, their specific legal form and place of registration shall be published on the Commission website. 
7. 
Entities entrusted with the implementation of financial instruments may open fiduciary accounts within the 
meaning of Article 85(3) on behalf of the Union. Those entities shall send the corresponding account statements to 
the Commission’s responsible service. Payments to fiduciary accounts shall be made by the Commission on the basis of 
payment requests that are duly substantiated with disbursement forecasts, taking into account the balances available on 
the fiduciary accounts and the need to avoid excessive balances on such accounts. 
Article 216 
Financial instruments directly implemented by the Commission 
1. 
Financial instruments may be directly implemented pursuant to point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1)

professional manager and in good faith. 
3. 
The managers of dedicated investment vehicles referred to in point (a) of paragraph 1 and financial intermediaries 
or final recipients of financial instruments shall be selected with due account to the nature of the financial instrument to 
be implemented, the experience and the financial and operational capacity of the entities concerned, and the economic 
viability of projects of final recipients. The selection shall be transparent, justified on objective grounds and shall not give 
rise to a conflict of interests. 
Article 217 
Treatment of contributions from funds implemented under shared management 
1. 
Separate records shall be kept for contributions to financial instruments established under this Section from funds 
implemented under shared management. 
2. 
Contributions from funds implemented under shared management shall be placed in separate accounts and used in 
accordance with the objectives of the respective funds to actions and final recipients consistent with the programme or 
programmes from which contributions are made. 
3. 
As regards contributions from funds implemented under shared management to financial instruments established 
under this Section, sector-specific rules shall apply. Notwithstanding the first sentence, managing authorities may rely on 
an existing ex ante evaluation, carried out in accordance with point (h) of the first subparagraph and the second 
subparagraph of Article 209(2), prior to contributing to an existing financial instrument.

at imminent risk of being in one of the exclusion situations referred to in points (a) and (d) of Article 136(1) of this 
Regulation or when a decision of the Authority for European political parties and European political foundations 
established under Article 6 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014 (‘the Authority’) has been communicated to

TITLE XII 
OTHER BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUMENTS 
Article 234 
Union trust funds for external actions 
1. 
For emergency and post-emergency actions necessary to react to a crisis, or for thematic actions, the Commission 
may establish Union trust funds for external actions (‘Union trust funds’) under an agreement concluded with other 
donors. 
Union trust funds shall only be established where agreements with other donors have secured contributions from other 
sources than the budget. 
The Commission shall consult the European Parliament and the Council on its intention to establish a Union trust fund 
for emergency and post-emergency actions. 
The establishment of a Union trust fund for thematic actions shall be subject to the approval of the European Parliament 
and of the Council. 
For the purposes of the third and fourth subparagraphs of this paragraph, the Commission shall make available to the 
European Parliament and to the Council its draft decisions concerning the establishment of a Union trust fund. Such draft 
decisions shall include a description of the objectives of the Union trust fund, the justification for its establishment in 
accordance with paragraph 3, an indication of its duration and the preliminary agreements with other donors. The draft 
decisions shall also include a draft constitutive agreement to be concluded with other donors. 
2. 
The Commission shall submit its draft decisions concerning the financing of a Union trust fund to the competent 
committee where provided for in the basic act under which the Union contribution to the Union trust fund is provided. 
The competent committee shall not be invited to pronounce itself on the aspects which have already been submitted to 
the European Parliament and to the Council for consultation or for approval under the third, fourth and fifth subpara­
graphs of paragraph 1 respectively. 
3. 
Union trust funds shall only be established and implemented subject to the following conditions: 
(a) there is added value of the Union intervention: the objectives of Union trust funds, in particular by reason of their 
scale or potential effects, may be better achieved at Union level than at national level and the use of the existing 
financing instruments would not be sufficient to achieve policy objectives of the Union; 
(b) Union trust funds bring clear political visibility for the Union and managerial advantages as well as better control by 
the Union of risks and disbursements of the Union and other donors’ contributions;
EN 
30.7.2018 
Official Journal of the European Union 
L 193/143
 
(c) Union trust funds do not duplicate other existing funding channels or similar instruments without providing any 
additionality; 
(d) the objectives of Union trust funds are aligned with the objectives of the Union instrument or budgetary item from 
which they are funded. 
4. 
A board chaired by the Commission shall be established for each Union trust fund to ensure a fair representation of 
the donors and to decide upon the use of the funds. The board shall include a representative of each non-contributing 
Member State as an observer. The rules for the composition of the board and its internal rules shall be laid down in the 
constitutive agreement of the Union trust fund. Those rules shall include the requirement that a vote in favour by the 
Commission is needed for the final adoption of the decision on the use of the funds. 
5. 
Union trust funds shall be established for a limited duration as determined in their constitutive agreement. That 
duration may be extended by a decision of the Commission subject to the procedure set out in paragraph 1 upon request 
of the board of the Union trust fund concerned and upon presentation by the Commission of a report justifying the 
extension, confirming, in particular, that the conditions set out in paragraph 3 are complied with. 
The European Parliament and/or the Council may request the Commission to discontinue appropriations for a Union 
trust fund or to revise the constitutive agreement with a view to the liquidation of a Union trust fund, where appropriate 
in particular on the basis of the information submitted in the working document referred to in Article 41(6). In such an 
event, any remaining funds shall be returned on a pro rata basis to the budget as general revenue and to the contributing 
Member States and other donors. 
Article 235 
Implementation of Union trust funds for external actions 
1. 
Union trust funds shall be implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, trans­
parency, proportionality, non-discrimination and equal treatment, and in accordance with the specific objectives defined 
in each constitutive agreement and in full respect of the rights of scrutiny and control of the Union contribution of the 
European Parliament and of the Council. 
2. 
Actions financed under Union trust funds may be implemented directly by the Commission pursuant to point (a) of 
the first subparagraph of Article 62(1) and indirectly with the entities implementing Union funds pursuant to points (c)(i), 
(ii), (iii), (v), and (vi) of the first subparagraph of Article 62(1). 
3. 
Funds shall be committed and paid by financial actors of the Commission, within the meaning of Chapter 4 of 
Title IV. The accounting officer of the Commission shall serve as the accounting officer of the Union trust funds. He or 
she shall be responsible for laying down accounting procedures and chart of accounts common to all Union trust funds. 
The Commission’s internal auditor, OLAF and the Court of Auditors shall exercise the same powers over Union trust 
funds as they do in respect of other actions carried out by the Commission. 
4. 
The contributions of the Union and of other donors shall not be integrated in the budget and shall be lodged in a 
specific bank account. The specific bank account of the Union trust fund shall be opened and closed by the accounting 
officer. All transactions made on the specific bank account during the year shall be properly accounted for in the 
accounts of the Union trust fund. 
Union contributions shall be transferred to the specific bank account on the basis of payment requests that are duly 
substantiated with disbursement forecasts, taking into account the balance available on the account and the resulting need 
for additional payments. Disbursement forecasts shall be provided on an annual, or where appropriate on a semi-annual, 
basis. 
The contributions of other donors shall be taken into account when cashed in the specific bank account of the Union 
trust fund and for the amount in euro resulting from the conversion at their reception on the specific bank account. 
Interests accumulated on the specific bank account of the Union trust fund shall be invested in the Union trust fund 
except where otherwise provided in the constitutive agreement of the Union trust fund. 
5. 
The Commission shall be authorised to use a maximum of 5 % of the amounts pooled into the Union trust fund to 
cover its management costs from the years in which the contributions referred to in paragraph 4 have started to be used. 
Notwithstanding the first sentence and in order to avoid the double charging of costs, management costs arising from the 
Union contribution to the Union trust fund shall only be covered by that contribution to the extent that those costs have 
not already been covered by other budget lines. For the duration of the Union trust fund, such management fees shall be 
assimilated to assigned revenue within the meaning of point (a)(ii) of Article 21(2).

respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law and in serious cases of corruption;

relevant operation funding, in the event that it is established that the payment of the relevant Union funds has been 
vitiated by serious irregularities attributable to that country.

fixed percentage of the gross employment costs, in line with a fixed percentage of time worked on the operation per 
month, with no obligation to establish a separate working time registration system. The employer shall issue a 
document for employees setting out that fixed percentage.
