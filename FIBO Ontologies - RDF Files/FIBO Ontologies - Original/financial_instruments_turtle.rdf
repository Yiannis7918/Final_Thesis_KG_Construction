Like other well-known market instruments such as convertible bonds, many structured products are hybrid securities. Structured products typically have two components - a debt instrument and a derivative, which is often an option. The debt instrument, in some instances, may pay interest at a specified rate and interval. The derivative component establishes payment at maturity, which may give the issuer the right to buy from you, or sell you, the referenced security or securities at a predetermined price. For example, structured products may combine characteristics of debt and equity or of debt and commodities.", "SEC Rule 434 defines structured securities as 'securities whose cash flow characteristics depend upon one or more indices or that have embedded forwards or options or securities where an investor's investment return and the issuer's payment obligations are contingent on, or highly sensitive to, changes in the value of underlying assets, indices, interest rates or cash flows'." ;

The Court stated that [a]n investment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. 66 S.Ct. at 1103.
